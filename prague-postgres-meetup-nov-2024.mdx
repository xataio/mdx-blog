## Prague PostgreSQL Meetup on November 18th

I am happy to announce that the next [Prague PostgreSQL Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/prague-postgresql-meetup/events/303386799) will take place on Monday, November 18th at 17:30 at [Spaces, Nile House](https://www.spacesworks.com/cz/prague-cz/nile-house/) (Karolinsk√° 654/2, 186 00 Praha 8-Rohansk√Ω ostrov).
This will be the seventh and final meetup of 2024, so if you are in the area, please join us to close out the year with Postgres! üá®üáø üíô üêò

We usually hold each meetup on the last Monday of the month, but I had a prior commitment on the last Monday of November, so we moved it to the 18th.
We also got some recurring feedback that the meetup talks are too long, so we decided to shorten the talks from 45 minutes to 30 minutes each this time.
This way, we can have more time for coffee and networking between talks.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for future meetups, please let me know!

## Event Sponsor Xata

Prague PostgreSQL Meetup is an active community of PostgreSQL enthusiasts in Prague, Czech Republic. We have 605 members and actively meet since 2018.
It is a free event and [organized by volunteers like me](https://www.meetup.com/prague-postgresql-meetup/members/?op=leaders).
We do not have any one company behind the meetup. Different companies sponsor the event, sometimes offering their office space, sometimes covering the catering expenses or both.

This time [Xata](https://xata.io/) sponsored the event, covering the venue rental, staff, and catering expenses.
It makes me double happy as the main organizer of the meetup and also a proud Xata employee! üéâ

## Session Highlights

  <b>Database Branching with PostgreSQL | No√©mi V√°nyi</b>
  <Box as="span" color="titleAccent">
    A recent buzzword on the database scene is branching. Now it is a basic feature of serverless PostgreSQL services,
    including Neon, Supabase and Xata. The concept is adapted from git, and its definition and usage is similar to that
    of git. A branch is an isolated database instance to test your changes to your database instance. Testing changes on
    branches gives you confidence to work with your database. PostgreSQL provides several building blocks and options to
    serve isolated databases to users. Learn how we implemented branches at Xata while keeping thousands of branches in
    the same PostgreSQL database.

  <b>pgroll - Zero-downtime, reversible schema changes for PostgreSQL | Tudor Golubenco</b>
  <Box as="span" color="titleAccent">
    [pgroll](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll) is a new open-source migration tool for Postgres that keeps multiple
    versions of a schema live during a migration, helping you roll out database schema changes without downtime. We'll
    look at how it works, how it automates the expand/contract pattern, and a quick demo.
