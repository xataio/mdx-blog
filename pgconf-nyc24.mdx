Xata is heading to New York this month as a Gold Sponsor of the upcoming [PGConf NYC 2024](https://postgresql.us/), a three day event for the PostgreSQL community. As a company that builds on the strengths of Postgres, this conference is particularly meaningful to usâ€”and weâ€™re looking forward to contributing to the vibrant discussions and innovation that surround the PostgreSQL community.

PGConf NYC brings together developers, database administrators, engineers, and open-source enthusiasts from across the globe, offering a unique opportunity to learn from experts, share experiences, and deep dive into the technical aspects of PostgreSQL. With Postgres continuing to grow as one of the most popular databases in the world, these community-focused events are important in shaping future innovations.

At Xata, weâ€™re passionate about Postgres and committed to making it even more accessible and powerful for developers. Xataâ€™s value proposition is simple: we bring the best of PostgreSQL and combine it with the [power of a serverless platform](https://xata.io/serverless-postgres). This means no more worrying about scaling, infrastructure, or managing your databaseâ€”Xata takes care of that, letting developers focus on what they do best: building.

At PGConf NYC, weâ€™ll be showcasing how Xata makes working with Postgres not only easier but also more productive. Whether youâ€™re interested in learning more about how to handle large datasets, streamline your workflows, or take advantage of the serverless revolution, our team will be on hand to answer your questions.

# Xataâ€™s featured talks

Weâ€™re hosting two technical talks at the conference that dive into some of the key challenges and solutions in the Postgres world.

## Postgres schema migrations using the expand/contract pattern

_Monday, 30th September â€“ 15:00 (The Hub)_

_Speaker: Andrew Farries, Software Engineer, Xata_

Schema migrations can be one of the trickiest parts of working with Postgres, especially in large-scale systems where downtime is not an option. In this talk, weâ€™ll introduce the [expand/contract pattern](https://xata.io/blog/pgroll-internals), a proven approach to schema migrations that minimizes risk and ensures backward compatibility throughout the process. Attendees will learn how to:

- Plan and execute schema changes while ensuring the stability of existing functionality.
- Avoid common pitfalls that can lead to downtime or data inconsistencies.
- Automate parts of the migration process to simplify future changes.

Andrew will introduce [pgroll](https://xata.io/pgroll), an open-source migration tool for Postgres, developed by Xata that keeps multiple versions of schema live during a migration, and he will show how it can be used to facilitate safe application rollouts across database schema changes.
If youâ€™re responsible for managing database schema changes in production, this session will provide actionable insights to help you avoid headaches and deploy with confidence.

## PostgreSQL operational pain points and solutions

_Tuesday, 1st October â€“ 10:40 (Library)_

_Speakers: [Monica Sarbu](https://twitter.com/monicasarbu), Founder & CEO, Xata | [Tudor Gulubenco](https://twitter.com/tudor_g), CTO, Xata_

Operating a Postgres database, especially at scale, comes with its share of challenges. From performance bottlenecks to schema changes or monitoring, this talk will address some of the most common operational pain points that teams face. More importantly, weâ€™ll be diving into practical solutions to address these issues. In this session, weâ€™ll cover:

- How to diagnose and resolve performance issues using real-world examples.
- The best practices for [major version upgrades in PostgreSQL](https://xata.io/blog/postgres-major-version-upgrades) environments.
- Tips around scaling and sharding strategies to stay ahead of potential problems.

Whether youâ€™re running a single Postgres instance or managing a complex cluster, this talk will equip you with the tools and strategies to ensure your database runs smoothly.

# Meet our team at the Xata booth

If you're attending the conference, be sure to stop by the Xata booth. Weâ€™ll have demos showing how Xata simplifies database management with zero operational overhead, and weâ€™ll be offering insights into how you can leverage Xataâ€™s serverless architecture to build faster and more efficiently on top of Postgres.

Plus, we love connecting with the communityâ€”whether itâ€™s to discuss a tough database problem youâ€™re facing or just to geek out over Postgres, weâ€™re excited to meet you! Oh and did we mention swag?! We wonâ€™t ruin any surprises so come meet the team and see for yourself ðŸ¦‹

Weâ€™re looking forward to PGConf NYC to share our love for Postgres with such an engaged community. Whether you're coming to learn from the experts, network with peers, or discover new technologies, we canâ€™t wait to meet you. See you in New York!
