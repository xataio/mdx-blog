In the past year, we've had a ton of fun hosting a [number of hackathons](https://xata.io/blog/tags/hackathon) and giving away cash prizes with premium swag to our community of Xataflies. That is why we're beyond excited to announce the second annual Xata Holiday Hackathon 🎉

It's the holiday season, and that means work is starting to wind down a bit. There's more time for family and friends. If you're fortunate (and brave) enough to travel during the holidays, maybe even a vacation. But with all that time on your hands, there's a nagging feeling in the back of your mind. You have had a million dollar idea that you've been wanting to build all year. Maybe you already bought the domain and have been sitting on it just waiting for the time to build.

We're here to tell you that now's your chance. With Xata Holiday Hackathon, you can turn that side project into a side hustle and win up to $500 for an app built on top of Xata. The best part? If it takes off, you can easily take that prototype to production scale with our [generous free tier](https://xata.io/pricing) in the new year. Take advantage of features like [file attachments](https://xata.io/docs/concepts/file-attachments), our [LangChain integrations](https://xata.io/docs/integrations/langchain) and [full-text search](https://xata.io/docs/sdk/search) to scratch that itch and build the next big thing.
