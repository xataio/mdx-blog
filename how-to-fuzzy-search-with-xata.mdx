One of my favorite features of Xata is the built-in "fuzzy search"
functionality. Most database solutions let you search for an exact match. Users
these days, though, often expect a more forgiving search, one that will match
"olso" to "oslo" and "alez" to "alex".

Fuzzy search to the rescue! 💪

> **FYI:** The example code uses a Xata Worker using the Xata SDK + a React component using ReactQuery. However, you may use any type of server-side + client-side setup you are comfortable with.

## Fuzzy Search Is Enabled by Default

Xata search functionality comes with the `fuzziness` param set to `1` by
default, letting the user make one typo, such as one wrong character
("ale**z**") or one set of swapped characters ("o**ls**o") etc. It's a great
default, and the one we use for
[pruneyourfollows.com](https://pruneyourfollows.com).

Nonetheless I do like to explicitly state the fuzziness level in the Code,
together with the configuration for partially matching words.

```tsx
import React, {useState} from "react";
import {useDebounce} from "usehooks-ts";
import {useQuery} from "@tanstack/react-query";
import {xataWorker} from "./xata";

// Code executed on the server as a Cloudflare Worker
const searchAccount = xataWorker("searchAccount", async ({xata}, {term}) => {
  const results = await xata.search.all(term, {
    tables: [
      {
        table: "accounts",
        target: ["name", "username"],
      },
    ],
    // Fuzziness level
    fuzziness: 1,
    // Partially matching words
    prefix: "phrase",
  });

  return results;
});

// Code executed in the browser
export default function App() {
  const [term, setTerm] = useState("");
  const debouncedTerm = useDebounce(term, 300);

  const {data: results} = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["search", debouncedTerm],
    queryFn: () => {
      return searchAccount({term: debouncedTerm});
    },
    enabled: Boolean(debouncedTerm),
    placeholderData: [],
  });

  return (
    <main>
      <form onSubmit={(event) => event.preventDefault()}>
        <label htmlFor="search-field">Search accounts: </label>
        <input
          id="search-field"
          type="search"
          value={term}
          placeholder="Search accounts: name or username"
          onChange={(event) => {
            setTerm(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
      </form>

      <ul>
        {results.map(({record}) => {
          return (
            <li key={record.username}>
              <a href={`http://twitter.com/${record.username}`}>
                <img src={record.meta.profile_image_url} aria-hidden={true} />
                <span
                  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                    __html: record.name,
                  }}
                />
                <br />
                @
                <span
                  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                    __html: record.username,
                  }}
                />
              </a>
            </li>
          );
        })}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Other possible levels of `fuzziness` are `0`, to disable it altogether, and `2`
to extend the allowed typo tolerance. Higher than `2` is not supported.

## Highlight the Relevant Text

In addition to expecting a more forgiving search, users expect to know precisely
_why_ a result matches their search term. With a fuzzy search, that is even more
crucial, as it can lead to some unexpected matches.

When your mind thinks "oslo" but you wrote "olso", the "Espen Olson" results
might feel strange when not highlighted.

Luckily, Xata generates ready-to-use HTML, wrapping the relevant matching text
in `<em>` for us. However, you need to use `getMetadata` on each record to get
access to it.

```tsx
import React, {useState} from "react";
import {useDebounce} from "usehooks-ts";
import {useQuery} from "@tanstack/react-query";
import {xataWorker} from "./xata";

// Code executed on the server as a Cloudflare Worker
const searchAccount = xataWorker("searchAccount", async ({xata}, {term}) => {
  const results = await xata.search.all(term, {
    tables: [
      {
        table: "accounts",
        target: ["name", "username"],
      },
    ],
    fuzziness: 1,
    prefix: "phrase",
  });

  // Getting the highlights (and more)
  const enrichedResults = results.map((result) => {
    return {
      ...result,
      ...result.record.getMetadata(),
    };
  });

  return enrichedResults;
});

//Code executed in the browser
export default function App() {
  const [term, setTerm] = useState("");
  const debouncedTerm = useDebounce(term, 300);

  const {data: results} = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["search", debouncedTerm],
    queryFn: () => {
      return searchAccount({term: debouncedTerm});
    },
    enabled: Boolean(debouncedTerm),
    placeholderData: [],
  });

  return (
    <main>
      <form onSubmit={(event) => event.preventDefault()}>
        <label htmlFor="search-field">Search accounts: </label>
        <input
          id="search-field"
          type="search"
          value={term}
          placeholder="Search accounts: name or username"
          onChange={(event) => {
            setTerm(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
      </form>

      <ul>
        {results.map(({record, highlight}) => {
          return (
            <li key={record.username}>
              <a href={`http://twitter.com/${record.username}`}>
                <img src={record.meta.profile_image_url} aria-hidden={true} />
                <span
                  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                    __html: highlight.name || record.name,
                  }}
                />
                <br />
                @
                <span
                  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
                    __html: highlight.username || record.username,
                  }}
                />
              </a>
            </li>
          );
        })}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Search Playground

Xata even allows you to play around with search—no code needed—using the Search
Engine Playground.

**Pro tip:** Use the "Get Code Snippet" feature to get a head start while
coding.
