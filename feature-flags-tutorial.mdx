In this tutorial, we're going to show you how to incorporate feature flags into your Astro app using Xata and Vercel. Imagine you're working on a feature that processes various email domains like @someone.com and @gmail.com. We'll guide you through setting up these feature flags in Xata, allowing for a controlled rollout of new features. This enables you to gather feedback from a select group of users before launching it more broadly. So, let's get started on enhancing your app's functionality.

### What are feature flags?

Feature flags are like digital switches that allow you to toggle features on and off at runtime without re-deploying your code. This enables teams to move faster, integrate custom workflows, and experiment with new functionalities on a certain set of users. In the event there's an issue, feature flags provide a quick mechanism for developers to disable problematic features without requiring a full code rollback.

### Before you begin

#### Tools you‚Äôll be using

- [Xata](https://xata.io) - A serverless database platform for data management.
- [Astro](https://astro.build) - A framework that combines frontend and serverless backend capabilities for building modern web apps.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)- A CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - A cloud platform for deploying and scaling web applications.

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce)
- A [Xata account](https://app.xata.io/signin)

### Configuring Xata

Start by [creating a Xata account](https://app.xata.io/signin), then log in to create a database.

After creating your database, you'll need to make a table for your feature flag attributes.

Great! Now that you've completed that step, you should see the table in its default state, as shown below üëáüèª

![](/images/feature-flags/table_created.png)

Let's move on to adding the feature flag with it‚Äôs relevant properties in the table you‚Äôve created.

### Creating feature flags in Xata

In this particular example, you‚Äôll create a feature flag that allows us to process email domains, such as `@someone.com`, `@gmail.com`, etc. and define a percentage number so that the feature flag can be rolled back whenever required.

First, add the `percentage` attribute. Click **+** and select **Integer**.

Set the column name to `percentage` and avoid any null values. Select the **Not null** option and set the default value to 51.

Great! Now, let‚Äôs add the `contains` attribute. By setting up a `contains` attribute, you can target specific conditions or criteria within your app. For instance, if the attribute is set to `@someone.com`, you can tailor the app's behavior for users with email addresses containing this domain. To add the attribute, click **+** and select **String** from the dropdown.

Set the column name to `contains` and again avoid any null values. Select the `Not null` option. Choosing the string data type allows you to specify text-based conditions. Marking the field as `Not null` ensures that every record in the database has a value for this attribute, maintaining the consistency and reliability of your data. Set a default value of, for example, `@someone.com`.

Awesome! We‚Äôre now done with configuring the feature flag table and now can use it in your frontend to customize the onboarding flow.

### Setting up the project

Fork the repository by navigating to the original GitHub repository at https://github.com/rishi-raj-jain/adding-feature-flags-to-your-astro-app-with-xata-and-vercel.
Click **Fork** at the top right corner of the page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

Once the repository is forked, clone it to your local machine. Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username in the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rishi-raj-jain/adding-feature-flags-to-your-astro-app-with-xata-and-vercel
cd adding-feature-flags-to-your-astro-app-with-xata-and-vercel
npm install
```

## Configure Xata with Astro

To use Xata with Astro, install the Xata CLI globally:

```bash
npm install @xata.io/cli -g
```

Authorize the Xata CLI to associate with the logged in account:

```bash
xata auth login
```

Great! Initialize the project locally with the Xata CLI command with something like what is presented below:

```bash
xata init --db https://Rishi-Raj-Jain-s-workspace-80514q.us-east-1.xata.sh/db/feature-flags-with-astro
```

Lastly, answer some quick prompts to make the integration with Astro seamless for you.

### Configure the Astro frontend

In this section, you'll learn how to customize an onboarding flow using feature flags set in Xata. You'll implement form actions in Astro routes, fetch feature flag from Xata, and define your own onboarding logic.

### Deploy to Vercel

The repository, is now ready to deploy to Vercel. Use the following steps to deploy: üëáüèª

1. Start by creating a GitHub repository containing your app's code.
1. Then, go to the Vercel Dashboard and create a 'New Project.'
1. Link this new project to the GitHub repository you just created.
1. Scroll down in the settings and update the 'Environment Variables' to match those in your local '.env' file.
1. Deploy! üöÄ
