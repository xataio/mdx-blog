### If pg_dump is not a backup tool, what is? 🦉

We all remember the sad day when Pluto was decommissioned as a planet. I’ve always liked Pluto—maybe it’s the name, or maybe it’s because it was the smallest, and I like supporting the underdog. Either way, it was sort of my favorite planet.

Recently, while [writing about the vulnerability affecting `pg_dump`](https://xata.io/blog/cve-2024-7348-postgres-upgrade), the topic of decommissioning `pg_dump` came up on Twitter. Unlike the nostalgic feelings many had for Pluto, there was less reluctance to see `pg_dump` reclassified. In fact, some people were eager to retire it as a backup utility, and I even got a bit of pushback for still referring to `pg_dump` as one 🙂

I was talking to my colleague Simona the other day, and she mentioned that everybody in Postgres circles says, “pg_dump is not a backup tool,” but perhaps it’s not always explained well _why_ it is not.

If you visit the `pg_dump` documentation page, it literally says this:

> `pg_dump` is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database. It makes consistent backups even if the database is being used concurrently.

But there is an upcoming change in its future, starting from Postgres 18, thanks to a commit from Peter Eisentraut.

**Commit:** `4f29394ea941f688fd4faf7260d2c198931ca797`

**Description:** _doc: Avoid too prominent use of "backup" on `pg_dump` man page_

Some users inadvertently rely on `pg_dump` as their primary backup tool, when better solutions exist. The `pg_dump` man page is arguably misleading in that it starts with:

> "pg_dump is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database."

This tones it down a little bit by replacing most uses of "backup" with "export" and adding a short note that `pg_dump` is not a general-purpose backup tool.

I am pleased that we are using better wording to explain the scope of `pg_dump` in the Postgres documentation.

What `pg_dump` does is take a snapshot of the database at that moment. However, it excludes certain crucial components, like WAL files and the global objects in the entire Postgres cluster.

In a moment of database disruption, you will need to restore your backups. And if you only have a `pg_dump` export and did not also back up your WAL directory, you would lose some of the transaction history. If you are doing replication, that would complicate things and could result in longer downtime or a more extended maintenance window if it’s a planned operation.

Backups ideally should be continuous. You shouldn’t have to worry about managing WALs and other objects back and forth between servers. You should have regular backups, continuously adding to them, and ideally restore them regularly to ensure everything is going well. It’s also important to monitor their health.

I won’t go into details about different backup tools here, but suffice it to say, `pg_dump` is not sufficient alone as a backup mechanism. It is a useful utility and helps a lot, but it’s not something you should consider a complete solution for backing up your Postgres clusters.
