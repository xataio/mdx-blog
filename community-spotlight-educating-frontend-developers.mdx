[Teri Eyenike](https://twitter.com/terieyenike) is a software engineer and technical writer based in Lagos, Nigeria. He has been with Xata since the very beginning, during our private beta back in 2021 and is a winner of our last [content hackathon](https://xata.io/blog/content-hackathon-winners-2023).

## Educating through Hackmamba

Teri is a software engineer by trade, but also a valued member of [Hackmamba](https://hackmamba.io/), a technical content marketing firm. They produce a variety of content ranging from deep technical topics to beginner tutorials. This is where Teri’s passion lies, in helping people learn new technologies and empowering them to build with it. This also provides Teri an opportunity to learn new languages, frameworks and tools on a regular basis.

> What I like about Xata is that there’s not much of a learning curve around it. You can easily integrate it with different technology stacks without having to comb through documentation.\

## Teaching databases with multiple languages

For the most part, databases are pretty language agnostic. Which really provides a great educational opportunity to build content around a standardized database while providing examples specific to each language and framework.

In Teri’s hackathon-winning tutorial, he walks developers through [building an efficient waitlist application with Xata and Next.js](https://dev.to/terieyenike/building-an-efficient-waitlist-app-with-nextjs-and-xata-caf).

As a frontend developer, Teri tends to create educational content within the JavaScript and Python ecosystems. In his latest tutorial, Teri is working on a new open source LinkTree alternative, [LinkPlant](https://github.com/Terieyenike/linktree). This is built using Django and will be the basis of future technical blogs and tutorials.

Teri continues to push the boundaries of technical, educational content by pursuing his passion to learn and exposing those learning to his audience. If you’re interested in the content he’s creating, check out his [work on dev.to](https://dev.to/terieyenike).

## Feedback and feature requests

During our conversation, we asked Teri to share some of his favorite parts about Xata and where he thinks we can improve. Here are some of the reasons why Teri continues to choose Xata:

- **Easy import.** When building technical tutorials for others to follow, getting data in can sometimes be the most difficult part. CSV import makes it very easy for his readers to get started.
- **File attachments.** With file attachments simply being an extension of the database, he reduces the number of tools required to build his example apps in his tutorials.
- **Collaborate.** Xata’s interface makes it really easy to collaborate with the entire team, regardless of technical experience.

> _Teri Eyenike - Software Engineer_

When asked what he’d like to see from Xata, here’s what Teri shared:

- **Django support.** As Teri dives deeper into the world of Python, he thought it might be nice for Xata to have more native support for Django.
- **Webhooks.** There were a few use cases where Teri would have liked to receive a notification every time a record is added. Outside of native support in Xata, webhooks would have made this pretty straight forward.
