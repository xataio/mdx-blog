Earlier this year we announced our [serverless Postgres platform](https://xata.io/blog/serverless-postgres-platform) and an early access program for [dedicated clusters](https://xata.io/blog/postgres-dedicated-clusters). Both of these offerings are core to Xata's evolution to becoming a Postgres database platform for faster development and a worry-free data layer. Serverless Postgres unlocks decades worth of community and tooling and dedicated clusters provide a more cost-predictable, performance and scalable solution for large production workloads.

Today we're excited to announce the next milestone in this evolution, a public beta for [dedicated clusters](https://xata.io/docs/dedicated-cluster)! ðŸŽ‰

Before diving into the specifics, we want to whole-heartedly thank our EAP customers for not only being early adopters, but providing amazing levels of feedback throughout the journey. Keep a look out, you'll all be receiving some premium Xata swag soon ðŸ’œ

## What is a dedicated cluster?

_As a reminder... (summmary / recap of shared and why we introduced dedicated and what you can do differently)_

## Celebrating with a limited-time offer

To celebrate our release, we will be offering $1,000 in credit for customers that start using dedicated cluster between now and its general availability later this year. This credit will be good through the end of 2025, but you will only have a few months to get this credit. You do not need to apply for it, any usage from a dedicated cluster will automatically be deducted from the credit and you have full control over what the deployment looks like.

If you're already a happy Xata customer, you can easily move all of your databases or a single branc to a dedicated cluster in just a few clicks.

## What's new

The team has been hard at work over the last few months building out features and functionality to provide the best experience to our beta customers. Starting today you can spin up Postgres versions `14` through `16` on a variety of cluster classes in both `us-east-1` and `eu-central-1`. We plan to introduce more versions, regions and extensions int he coming months, so please let us know what you'd like to see.

## Serverless Postgres, the SQL

Sorry, I had to to lead with the dad-joke. It was just too easy. As you'll soon seen, dedicated clusters has only been a portion of our focus since our [last launch week](https://xata.io/launch-week-unleash-the-elephant). We've also spent time improving our Postgres offering, the tooling around it and improving the use cases and workflows our customers have been asking for.

Today we're not only announcing the public beta for dedicated clusters, but we're also opening up access to enable direct access to Postgres as part of our database creation workflow ðŸ¥³

Over the last few months, the interest we've seen and the feedback we've received has been overwhelming. Again, we can't thank you enough to our early adopters ðŸ¦‹

**Even more compatible with your favorite clients and tooling**
_Deep dive into the specifics of the work that went in here and the ORMs / clients / tooling now supported (with links). New statements, ORMs & tooling support, adapt a table flow improvements, multiple schema support, configurable search path_

**Playground upgraded to Queries**
_Highlight with screenshots -- new query view, saved queries, run multiple SQL statements at once_

**Bring your Postgres**
_Invite folks to migrate and bring over their Postgres with pgdump / pgrestore_
