Get ready to level up your database game because Xata is expanding its reach! We're all about listening to our amazing community and making things happen. That's why we're thrilled to announce that we're taking action on one of our dev community’s [top requests](https://xata.canny.io/feature-requests/p/new-region-ap-southeast-2) and are introducing the addition of two new Xata regions: Sydney and Frankfurt.

At Xata, we understand the importance of global accessibility and scalability, as well as the challenges developers face when it comes to managing databases. Whether it's the Eastern or Western US, Dublin, Frankfurt, or Sydney, developers can leverage Xata’s reliable and scalable database services.

## Why the region matters?

When selecting the right region, the location where the underlying infrastructure supporting your database is located, you are choosing where your data is stored and how it is processed.

Selecting the right region for your database is crucial for a number of reasons: 

- **Data security and compliance*:** In the world of data, each country and region has its unique set of data privacy and compliance regulations. By selecting a specific region for your database, you can guarantee that your data is stored and processed in strict accordance with the required security measures and legal obligations. You can ensure your data handling procedures meet the necessary standards and safeguards, providing peace of mind regarding data privacy and protection. Our supported regions are hosted in AWS. Check out our docs to learn more about Xata’s [security policies](https://xata.io/security).
- **Performance Optimization**: The physical distance between your application and the database can impact performance - proximity does matter! By selecting a region that is closer to your users or application servers, you can minimize latency and enhance user experiences. Strategically choosing a region can help boost speeds and ensure your users enjoy a seamless and responsive application performance.
- **Disaster Recovery and Redundancy:** Distributed databases across multiple regions provide robust disaster recovery capabilities. If one region experiences an outage or disruption, your data remains available and accessible from other regions, ensuring continuity.

## Expanding Xata’s reach

By extending our Xata regions to include additional locations in the Pacific and Europe, we aim to offer developers a comprehensive solution for their serverless database needs. Whether you're building a robust e-commerce platform, an AI application using vector-search, or a high-performance API, our infrastructure is ready to support your requirements.

Exciting plans for the future lie ahead as we continue to expand our offerings, with additional regions in the pipeline. Our goal is to continually enhance the Xata platform, empowering developers and businesses worldwide to leverage the full potential of PostgreSQL databases in a serverless environment. We believe in fostering a collaborative and supportive developer community, and your feedback is essential in shaping the future of our platform. Your support and participation are appreciated, and we're excited to hear about your experiences working with the new regions. Your insights and observations are crucial in helping us provide the best possible experience.
