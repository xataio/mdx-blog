[Emanuel Arcos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanuelarcos/), a full-stack developer from Buenos Aires with over 7 years of e-commerce experience, is making waves. He recently left the e-commerce world to become and entrepreneur and start his compnay Triqueta Software Solutions, with his eyes set on a brand new type of subscription service.

## From scaffolding to solutions

Emanuel discovered Xata through the [Next.js conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TVkTrZFizo) last year and thought he would try it out for his newest venture. Back then, he wasnâ€™t thinking about building a SaaS solution for hotel management. He was focused on building management software for two businesses heâ€™s a partner in â€” a kinesiology center and a local hotel.

With a stack built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Tremor](https://www.tremor.so/), he was in search of a serverless database. Remembering Xata, he realized it checked the boxes for reliability, operational management, and feature sets he was looking for. Emanuel admitted that in the beginning, it was a little scary choosing Xata. When a platform is new and youâ€™re building a big application, itâ€™s important to really trust it. In a sense, itâ€™s a gamble.

What turned him around? Our community was the largest deciding factor.

His first management software project was for a kinesiology center. Emanuel created a system that handled scheduling, invoices, and administration, transforming the center's operations and business.

With learnings from this business, he expanded on the application scaffolding and applied some of the same ideas and capabilities to hotel management workflows. The application he built handles check-ins, monitors client transactions, stores bookings in a calendar, handles room inventory, and even sends quotes via WhatsApp to future customers.

The foundation around all these experiences are built on Xata. Booking and transactions are stored as relations between tables, finance time series data leverages the aggregation endpoint, and the app itself puts the Xata TypeScript SDK to heavy use. Because Xata removed a lot of complexity at the data layer and plugged right into his developer workflow, Emanuel was able to build out both of these solutions in just a few months.

> Xata was a game-changer for me. Iâ€™m not great at DevOps and database infrastructure management, which I find rather tedious. Xata takes care of this with an excellent developer experience. Thanks to Xata, I was able to build out both of these applications in just two months.\n

## Turning success into a subscription

These days, Emanuel is building off of his success in crafting these different management solutions and planning to deliver a suite of functionality for a full-fledged hotel management SaaS solution.

The global hotel and hospitality management software market is expected to grow at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of approximately 8-10% over the years leading up to 2025. This growth can be attributed to increasing technological adoption in the hospitality industry. There is a ton of opportunity here and Emanuel is excited to enter this space.

He plans to offer various features, including scheduling, invoice generation, inventory, and revenue management, across different tiers. Hotels can then select from these options, much like an a la carte menu, to best meet their requirements.

The new software is still in the works, and Emanuel is planning to add full-text search and file attachments to a number of experiences. If youâ€™re interested in learning more, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to Emanuel on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanuelarcos/).

## Feedback and feature requests

As we chatted about the future, we asked Emanuel to share some of his favorite parts about Xata and where he thinks we can improve. Here were some of the reasons Emanuel chose Xata for his businesses.

- **Xataflies.** Throughout the interview, Emanuel gave many shout outs to the responsiveness and engagement of the Xata community.
- **Zero DevOps required.** Not having to worry about database monitoring or management was one of the key deciding factors of choosing Xata for his solutions.
- **Tool consolidation.** The combination of OLTP and OLAP data stores allowed Emanuel to simplify his architecture for future and current transactional, time series, full-text search and storage use cases.
- **Developer experience.** The TypeScript SDK and in-app playground experiences made development much faster across the board.

When asked what heâ€™d like to see from Xata, hereâ€™s what Emanuel shared.

- **Better support for Next.js server components**. Emanuel is using the app router paradigm in Next.js and ran into some issues caching Xata results using the SDK directly on the server components. Heâ€™s looking for better support in the docs for this use case.
- **Lower latency globally.** Related to the caching use case, Emanuel would like to see better support and lower latency on the edge.
