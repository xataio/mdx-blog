We‚Äôre excited to invite you to join our summer hackathon in collaboration with our friends at [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/)!

Over the past year, we‚Äôve noticed that many of our customers were using the PXCI (Prisma, Xata, Clerk and Inngest) stack and thought it would be fun to host a hackathon for our joint community. As part of our upcoming Xata Launch Week in July 2024, we‚Äôre bringing you a two-week coding challenge like no other. Whether you're a solo developer or part of a duo, this is your chance to showcase your creative skills, collaborate with a vibrant community, and win fantastic prizes!
