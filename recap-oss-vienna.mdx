## Recap of OSS Vienna: What's Happening in the Open Source World 📝

We were at the Open Source Summit Europe in Vienna from September 16-18.
We had our booth, spoke with hundreds of people and received really positive feedback on our open-source tools.
We also hosted a [Postgres Happy Hour](https://xata.io/blog/oss-vienna-happy-hour) and the discussions were so enjoyable thay we even ended up having dinner with some attendees who stayed until the end of our two-hour event!

This was my first time at Open Source Summit and I am already looking forward to the [next one](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/) taking place in Amsterdam, Netherlands from August 25-27, 2025.

## Day 0

I must say the weather in Prague (my departure city), especially in the south of the Czech Republic, resembled what I imagine biblical floods would look like.
Travelling to Vienna (my destination) was not fun, to say the least. I was fortunate that my flight was not canceled and I managed to arrive on the same day as planned, unlike many others who had planned to use trains and could not even make it to their own talks.

I intended to get my badge and set up our booth on Sunday but trip to Vienna was enough as it was, so we will jump directly to Day 1 😊
However, I met my colleague Simona for the first time, and we had dinner together with her my friend Yasar.

## Day 1

I arrived to the venue very early, after struggling with my umbrella I borrowed from the hotel, carrying a luggage full of swag and a box with helium tank in it 😅 
Luckily I met the kindest two people at the hotel breakfast and they helped me to carry everything. Thanks Susan Remmert and X, you made it so much easier for me to settle into the conference!

### The Zephyr Project

If you are interested in [The Zephyr Project](https://zephyrproject.org/), go follow Susan! She was hosting a workshop at the summit.

Quoting from the #ZephyrRTOS [Github page](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/main):

> The Zephyr Project is a scalable real-time operating system (RTOS) supporting multiple hardware architectures, optimized for resource constrained devices, and built with security in mind.</p>
> The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated smart watches and IoT wireless gateways.</p>
> The Zephyr kernel supports multiple architectures, including ARM (Cortex-A, Cortex-R, Cortex-M), Intel x86, ARC, Nios II, Tensilica Xtensa, and RISC-V, SPARC, MIPS, and a large number of supported boards.</p>

You can join community [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ck7jw53nU2) if you are interested.

### Xata Booth

Then, Noémi and Simona arrived. We got our badges and moved to the sponsor area to set up our booth.
I also met Noémi for the first time, but we three really got along and our booth was probably the happiest booth with the sit-com level background laughter for the next 3 days 😂

### Linus Torval's Keynote

The highlight of the first day was the opening keynote where [Linus Torvals and Dirk Hohndel had a discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM_8UOPFpqE&list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pwSxJqsghZ1XVNb7pngzJv&index=18).

Quotes from Linux Torvals / aging community, sustainability, not exciting release but stable.

## Day 2

### Extension Ecosystem Summit

On the second day my friend [Alastair Turner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/decodableminion/) visited me at the Xata booth. While I was showcasing our open source projects via the cutest stickers of each of them he noticed [pgzx](https://github.com/xataio/pgzx) which is our open source framework for creating Postgres extensions in Zig language.
He mentioned that our common friend [Floor Drees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/floordrees/) is organizing an event on the Day 0 of [PGConf.EU](https://2024.pgconf.eu/) dedicated for Postgres extensions and he will be giving a talk about [pg_tde](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/pg_tde) there.
And he suggested pgzx would fit perfectly for the extensions discussion as it allows developers to build Postgres extensions. I took his advice and contacted Floor, and I will give giving a talk about pgzx at the [Extensions Ecosystem Summit](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/extension-ecosystem-summit-tickets-1022518730047).
