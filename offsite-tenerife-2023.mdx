Picture this: a dynamic team of 27 talented individuals, scattered across various corners of the globe, dedicatedly working on crafting a top-notch serverless Postgres database system. While remote work fosters flexibility and efficiency, there's an irreplaceable magic in face-to-face interactions. At Xata, we cherish these opportunities, ensuring to get together at an offsite twice a year, not just for work collaboration but to strengthen our bonds and extend the warmth of our Xata family to our team members' loved ones.

This time, our journey led us to the stunning landscapes of Tenerife, where from November 13th to 17th, we embarked on an adventure filled with work, exploration, and camaraderie.

### Monday

The energy was palpable as our team arrived in Tenerife, greeted by the warm embrace of our destination. We kicked off the evening with a welcome cocktail, a chance for everyone to unwind and mingle in a relaxed setting. Later, a delightful dinner served as the perfect backdrop for reconnecting and getting to know our new team members.

As our team trickled in from different corners of the world, we were greeted by the warm embrace of tropical Tenerife as much of our home countries started experiencing the first seriously cold days. We started the offsite off with a relaxed welcome cocktail on a beautiful terrace overlooking the island, an occasion for both seasoned members and new faces to mingle in an informal setting. Each of us received a specially curated welcome package, including personalized Club Xata merchandise and matching sunglasses. We ended the day with a delightful gala dinner before heading to bed excited for the days to come.

### Tuesday

In sync with Xata tradition, Tuesday was dedicated to immersive work sessions. We started the morning with an all-hands session celebrating the successes of the past year and looking ahead to our mission for the coming months and year.

We spent the rest of the day in several cross-functional teams focusing on specific obstacles or developing new ideas for Xata.

After a successful and productive work day, we took a scenic walk to a local restaurant and celebrated the first day with a typical Canarian roast.

### Wednesday

Wednesday presented a perfect blend of productivity and adventure.

After another morning spent brainstorming, planning additions to our existing product features, and innovating fresh concepts, we made our way to the central volcano of the island - Mount Teide . As we ascended the mountain, we saw the landscape change from palms to evergreen forests to a sort of black and red rock desert that looked almost Martian and certainly made us feel like we were transported to another planet.

We watched a beautiful sunset from one of the highest points of the mountains and shared a picnic-style dinner at over 2000m above sea level. The Teide volcano is the third-best location in the entire world to watch the stars, so that was one of the activities we surely couldn't miss out on!

Equipped with professional telescopes and a night sky guide, we were able to see Saturn and Jupiter up close and learn many new constellations and their history.

### Thursday

We started Thursday divided into two groups, one heading off to Loro Parque, Tenerife's largest zoo, the other spending the morning relaxing on a beautiful catamaran in the Atlantic Ocean.

Whether it was parrots or whales, we all for sure got our share of seeing unique animals native to the Canary Islands and its surrounding waters.

Later that day we came together for the final experience of our offsite: a tour of one of Tenerife's most special vineyards (including a tasting of their incredible assortment of wines) followed by a last celebratory dinner overlooking the ocean.

Even after we arrived back at the hotel, we were not ready to say goodbye just yet and stayed up late sitting at the poolside bar. We heard many stories of how each of us found their way to the Xata team, both by seasoned and completely new members, and shared visions of the future.

### Friday

Friday (as always at these types of events) approached much faster than expected and all of a sudden it was time to bid farewell not only to the sunny landscapes of Tenerife but to new friends and old colleagues and the experiences we shared. Departing back to our respective homes across the world, we are carrying with us a new bond and unity as a team, a rejuvenated enthusiasm for Xata's future, and an album full of unforgettable memories.

## Our Lasting Impressions

Our Tenerife offsite served as a testament to the power of in-person connections. From face-to-face work sessions to fun activities, each moment created a deeper sense of unity and purpose within us. Every time we get together as Club Xata, we get refreshed as a team and are able to collaborate even better than before. As one of our team members put it, an offsite turns a profile picture into a real person and transforms Slack channels into true teamwork and friendship.

All that said, we cannot wait for #club-xata-2024
