**Picture this:** a dynamic team of 27 talented individuals, scattered across various corners of the globe, dedicatedly working on crafting a serverless Postgres database platform.

While remote work fosters flexibility and efficiency, there's an irreplaceable magic in face-to-face interactions. At Xata, we cherish these opportunities, ensuring to get together at an offsite twice a year, not just for work collaboration but to strengthen our bonds and extend the warmth of our Xata family to our team members' loved ones.

This time, our journey led us to the stunning landscapes of Tenerife, where from November 13th to 17th, we embarked on an adventure filled with work, exploration, and camaraderie. Each day of the weeklong offsite was thoughtfully crafted with activities that bonded us and enriched our experience.

## Monday

Our team gathered in Tenerife, a warm and welcoming contrast to the cold beginning to grip our home countries. The offsite started with casual welcome cocktails on a terrace with stunning island views, providing the perfect environment for both long-time and new team members to socialize. With Xata's growth of over 25% in the past year, seasoned members and newcomers had the opportunity to meet in person, some for the first time. Everyone received a custom welcome package, complete with Club Xata gear and matching sunglasses.

The day concluded with a wonderful gala dinner, setting the stage for the exciting days ahead.

## Tuesday

In sync with Xata tradition, Tuesday was dedicated to immersive work sessions. We started the morning with an all-hands session celebrating the successes of the past year and looking ahead to our mission for the coming months and year.

Over the past year, we have launched numerous new features including [file attachments](https://xata.io/docs/concepts/file-attachments), SQL proxy, and a completely redesigned user interface. Additionally, we introduced a new website, tackled schema migration issues with [pgroll](https://xata.io/blog/pgroll-schema-migrations-postgres), and significantly enhanced our Python and Go SDK offerings, among other developments.

The day involved collaboration among various cross-functional teams, each focusing on specific challenges and brainstorming new ideas for Xata.

Following a fruitful and productive day of work, we embarked on a scenic stroll to a charming local eatery, where we capped off the day with a delightful Canarian roast, savoring the flavors of the region.

## Wednesday

Wednesday presented a perfect blend of productivity and adventure.

After another morning spent brainstorming, planning additions to our existing product features, and innovating fresh concepts, we made our way to the central volcano of the island - Mount Teide. As we ascended the mountain, we witnessed the transformation of scenery from palm trees to evergreen forests, eventually leading us to a desert-like expanse of black and red rocks. This surreal, almost Martian landscape gave us the exhilarating feeling of being transported to another planet.

We watched a beautiful sunset from one of the highest points of the mountains and shared a picnic-style dinner at over 2,000 meters above sea level. The Teide volcano is known as one of the world's premier stargazing spots due to its high altitude and clear skies, so that was one activity we surely couldn't miss out on!

Equipped with professional telescopes and a night sky guide, we were able to see Saturn and Jupiter up close, as well as learn about several constellations and their history.

## Thursday

On Thursday, our team split into two groups for different adventures: one visited Loro Parque, Tenerife's largest zoo, while the other group enjoyed a relaxing morning on a scenic catamaran trip in the Atlantic Ocean.

Whether observing parrots or spotting whales, everyone certainly had the chance to see unique wildlife native to the Canary Islands and its surrounding waters.

Later that day, we regrouped for our offsite's final event: a tour and tasting at one of Tenerife's exceptional vineyards, capped off with a celebratory dinner offering ocean views.

Even after we arrived back at the hotel, we were not ready to say goodbye just yet and stayed up late chatting by poolside. Stories flowed from both long-standing and new members of the Xata team, recounting their unique journeys to joining us; we also exchanged our hopes and plans for the future, painting a collective vision while reflecting on the past week.

## Friday

Friday arrived much faster than expected, a common feeling at these events. Suddenly, it was time to say goodbye: to the sunny landscapes of Tenerife, to new friends and old colleagues, and to the memorable experiences we shared. As we left for our respective homes across the world, we carried with us a new bond as a team, a rejuvenated enthusiasm for Xata's future, and an album full of unforgettable memories.

## Lasting impressions

Our Tenerife offsite served as a testament to in-person connection, but also to cultivating a team that "just gels". From face-to-face work sessions to fun activities, each moment created a deeper sense of unity and purpose for our Xata vision.

Every time we get together as Club Xata, we get refreshed as a team and are able to collaborate even better than before. As one of our team members put it "An offsite turns a profile picture into a real person and transforms Slack channels into true teamwork and friendship."

All that said, we cannot wait for #club-xata-2024!
