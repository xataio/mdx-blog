The Xata team has been hard at work all summer building the features you‚Äôve been asking for. To commemorate the end of the season, we're launching our latest features in a week-long event. Join us in celebrating our launch week, complete with a content hackathon. Summer is not over yet, let‚Äôs enjoy one last party! üéâ üéä ü•≥ üçæ

To stay up to date with the latest info, keep an eye on this page and watch for updates on [X / Twitter](https://twitter.com/xata) or [subscribe to our blog](https://xata.io/blog#subscribe-blog). We‚Äôll update our blog every day with the latest announcements.

## Releases

To make things more fun, we‚Äôre giving a riddle-like hint for each day. The first day is already revealed, but can you guess what we‚Äôre announcing in the other days? If yes, [tell us](https://twitter.com/xata/status/1696162078619320452?s=20) on the social network formally known as Twitter and you‚Äôll get points in our [content hackathon](#xata-content-hackathon-!) (see below).
