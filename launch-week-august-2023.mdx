The Xata team has been hard at work all summer building the features you’ve been asking for. To commemorate the end of the season, we're launching our latest features in a week-long event. Join us in celebrating our launch week, complete with a content hackathon. Summer is not over yet, let’s enjoy one last party! 🎉 🎊 🥳 🍾

To stay up to date with the latest info, keep an eye on this page and watch for updates on [X / Twitter](https://twitter.com/xata) or [subscribe to our blog](https://xata.io/blog#subscribe-blog). We’ll update our blog every day with the latest announcements.

## Releases

To make things more fun, we’re giving a riddle-like hint for each day. The first day is already revealed, but can you guess what we’re announcing in the other days? If yes, [tell us](https://twitter.com/xata/status/1696162078619320452?s=20) on the social network formally known as Twitter and you’ll get points in our [content hackathon](#xata-content-hackathon-!) (see below).

| | Hint | Release blog post(s) |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |
| Monday | The most popular data format is not necessarily the best. Or is it? | Effortlessly [import and export your data using the new CSV implementation](/blog/csv-import-export). Sounds simple, but the devil is in the details. |
| Tuesday | Snakes usually don’t like to be confined, but what happens if you try to put one in chains? | Our Python SDK is now [officially in general availability](/blog/announcing-the-python-sdk-ga)! And if you're using Xata for an AI use case, we now have [vector and in-memory store integrations for both Python and JavaScript](https://needblogurl.com). |
| Wednesday | Mulder and Scully have a new case on their hands. It’s a big one! | \[To be revealed on Wednesday] |
| Thursday | The show is not over, a sequel is coming soon. | \[To be revealed on Thursday] |
| Friday | TODO: Jason, please don't forget to add this one. | \[To be revealed on Friday] |
