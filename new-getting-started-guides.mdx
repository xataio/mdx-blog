Our mission at Xata is to radically simplify the way developers work with data. This is ingrained in everything we do, from
our products to the educational material we create to enable you to get the most out of Xata. So, today, as part of
[Xata launch week](/blog/launch-week-august-2023), we're excited to share six new getting started guides for the
these popular full-stack JavaScript frameworks: Astro, Remix, SolidStart, SvelteKit, Next.js, and Nuxt.

The new getting started with Xata guides for [Astro][astro], [Remix][remix], [SolidStart][solidstart], [SvelteKit][sveltekit],
[Next.js][nextjs], and [Nuxt][nuxt], walk you through building a blog application and demonstrate features such as:

- Using the [Xata CLI][cli] to create a database
- Defining a database schema and seeding the database by [importing a CSV][csv]
- [Querying and filtering][query-filter]
- [Full-text fuzzy search][search]

We'd love to hear from you if you have any feedback on the guides or if you'd like to see guides for other frameworks or technologies.
So, reach out to us on [Discord](/discord) or join us on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/xata).
