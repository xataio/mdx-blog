Our mission at Xata is to simplify the way developers work with data. This is ingrained in everything we do, from
our products to the educational material we create to enable you to get the most out of Xata. So, today, as part of
[Xata launch week](/blog/launch-week-august-2023), we're excited to share six new getting started guides for the
these popular full-stack JavaScript frameworks: Astro, Remix, SolidStart, SvelteKit, Next.js, and Nuxt.

The new getting started with Xata guides for [Astro][astro], [Remix][remix], [SolidStart][solidstart], [SvelteKit][sveltekit],
[Next.js][nextjs], and [Nuxt][nuxt], walk you through building a blog application and in doing so help you learn some Xata fundamentals.

The guides demonstrate features such as:

- Using the [Xata CLI][cli] to create a database
- Defining a database schema and seeding the database by [importing a CSV][csv]
- TypeScript [code generation][codegen] with database branching
- [Querying and filtering][query-filter]
- [Full-text fuzzy search][search]

## Astro

With the recent launch of [Astro 3.0][astro-3], now is a great time to dive into the Xata and Astro getting started guide.
This guide demonstrates using Xata database and full-text search in combination with Astro features
such as [SSG (Static Site Generation)][astro-ssg], [dynamic routes][astro-dynamic], and [Server Side Rendering (SSR)][astro-ssr]
via Astro "hybrid" mode.

## Remix

The getting started with Xata and Remix guide shows how to build a database driven application with full-text fuzzy search.
It covers using the [`useLoaderData` Remix hook][remix-hook] to load data from a Xata database, using [Remix dynamic segments][remix-dynamic]
to pass parameters within URLs, and making use of search parameters within a Remix application to integrate Xata's full-text fuzzy search.

## SolidStart

SolidStart is current in beta but shows a lot of promise. This new Xata with SolidStart getting started guide is an opportunity to learn some
of the basics of Xata, [SolidStart][solidstart-website], and [SolidJS][solidjs]. It covers using [`createServerData$`][solid-createserverdata] and
[`useRouteData`][solid-useroutedata] to load data from a Xata database, using the [`<Match />` and `<Switch />`][solid-match-switch], and [`<For />`][solid-for]
SolidJS logic operators for conditional UI rendering, defining and accessing path parameters using [dynamic routing][solid-routing], and how to access and
utilize search parameters within a SolidStart application to integrate Xata's full-text fuzzy search.
