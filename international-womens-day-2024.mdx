This year's International Women’s Day theme of "Inspire Inclusion," underscores the importance of fostering an environment where every woman, regardless of background, identity, or circumstance, feels valued and empowered to participate fully in society.

Organizations play a pivotal role in this. Achieving equality through fostering inclusive workplaces, which goes beyond mere representation. It means dismantling barriers that hinder women from realizing their full potential in the workplace and advocating for equal opportunities at all organizational levels, from entry to leadership. Women are more ambitious than ever as the recent [2023 Women in the Workplace Study](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace) by Lean In and Mckinsey & Co found. The key to unlocking women’s ambitions? Workplace flexibility.

As a female-founded company, I found this year's theme of Inspiring Inclusion resonates profoundly with our ethos at Xata where we have made it a priority to cultivate a culture that is flexible and where every individual employee feels valued, respected, and empowered to thrive.

It was a search for diversity and inclusion that sparked our Founder & CEO Monica's idea to start Xata in the first place. Having heard accounts of discrimination and burnout, she set up a non-profit organization Tupu.io to help tech companies support diversity in tech through mentorship. It was while searching for a serverless database to store details of all the mentors and mentees that the idea for Xata was born.

We know that everyone's circumstances are different so the ability to work remotely makes it possible for people to build work around their lives, not the other way around. That’s why we are a 100% remote team distributed across Europe and the US, and an asynchronous workplace. We believe a person’s career shouldn’t be determined by proximity to a physical office, and with flexibility in where we work, we’ve been able to continue building a talented and diverse team, brought together from a variety of backgrounds, cultures and countries, who bring different experiences and perspectives. It’s no surprise one of our core [values](https://xata.io/careers) is Diverse by Default.

At the heart of Xata’s commitment to inclusion is a proactive approach to recruitment and talent development. We actively seek to attract and retain women across all levels of the organization. Our team is currently 43% female, and we have an all-female board of directors. We prioritize the advancement, support and professional development of our people, through mentorship programs, training and networking opportunities to empower them to thrive in their careers.

As we celebrate International Women's Day it’s important to reflect on the strides made in achieving gender equality while recognising the work that still lies ahead. At Xata we strongly believe that our success is driven by the talented and diverse team brought together from a variety of backgrounds, genders, cultures and countries. We commit to challenging ourselves every day to build an inclusive culture.

We’re always looking for talented people who align with our values. If you decide to apply, we’re rooting for you! https://xata.io/careers
