[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is a very popular TypeScript ORM that provides type safe access to your database, automated migrations, and a custom data model definition.

With [this week's beta release of Xata's Postgres service](/blog/serverless-postgres-platform) you are now able to connect to your Xata database with Drizzle over the Postgres wire protocol too with the `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` or `drizzle-orm/postgres-js` drivers.

Also, we are excited to announce that we have added support for the `drizzle-orm/xata-http` driver. This driver allows you to connect to your Xata database using the Xata HTTP API. This is a great option if you are using Drizzle in a serverless environment or if you are using a language that does not have a native Postgres driver.

## Setting up with Xata

Before starting you will need an empty Xata database that has direct access to Postgres enabled.

### Creating a new database

You will first need to enable direct access to Postgres in your workspace settings.

You will also need to enable direct access to Postgres when you create your new database.

After this point you will want to update your Xata SDK to the `next` release to ensure you have the latest beta features.

```bash
$ npm install @xata.io/client@next # yarn install or pnpm install
```

## Setting up Drizzle

There are two ways to set up Drizzle: using the native Postgres adapters or the Xata HTTP adapter.

### node-postgres

To use Drizzle with the `node-postgres` driver, you will need to install the `drizzle-orm` and `pg` packages.

```bash
$ npm install drizzle-orm pg # yarn install or pnpm install
```

After that, you can use Drizzle as you normally would, but with the `node-postgres` driver.

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client
import { Client } from 'pg';

const xata = getXataClient();
const client = new Client({ connectionString: xata.sql.connectionString });
const db = drizzle(client);
```

### postgres-js

To use Drizzle with the `postgres-js` driver, you will need to install the `drizzle-orm` and `postgres-js` packages.

```bash
$ npm install drizzle-orm postgres # yarn install or pnpm install
```

After that, you can use Drizzle as you normally would, but with the `postgres-js` driver.

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client
import postgres from 'postgres';

const xata = getXataClient();
const client = postgres(xata.sql.connectionString);
const db = drizzle(queryClient);
```

### xata-http

To use Drizzle with the `xata-http` driver, you will need to install the `drizzle-orm` package.

```bash
$ npm install drizzle-orm # yarn install or pnpm install
```

After that, you can use Drizzle as you normally would, but with the `xata-http` driver.

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/xata-http';
import { getXataClient } from './xata'; // Generated client

const xata = getXataClient();
const db = drizzle(xata);
```

## Get started

And that's it, it's that easy to [connect Drizzle to your Xata database](https://xata.io/docs/integrations/drizzle). This functionality is currently only available with the public beta of our Postgres service.
