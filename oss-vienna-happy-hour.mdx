## Postgres Happy Hour with Xata at Open Source Summit Europe

On September 16-18th, we'll be at the [Open Source Summit Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/) in Vienna, Austria.

We will have a booth in the expo area where we will be happy to talk to you about Postgres and Xata.
For me personally, it is extra special as this will be my first time doing booth duty as a new Xata employee.

If you are attending Open Source Summit, please stop by our booth and say hi!
If you want to set up a time to chat, send me an email at gulcin@xata.io.

## Join us for the Postgres Happy Hour!

It is not only booth duty, but I am happy to announce that we'll be also hosting a [Postgres Happy Hour at the Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/features/co-located-events/#postgres-happy-hour-with-xata) on September 18th!

At Xata, we are passionate about PostgreSQL and its role in powering modern applications.
We believe that PostgreSQL is more than just a database; it is a fundamental technology that enables innovation and growth in the tech industry.
And we are excited to celebrate this awesome project with the Postgres community at the Open Source Summit Europe!

The event is free and open to everyone, even if you are not attending the Open Source Summit.
However, the space is limited to 50 attendees and we would like you to fill out [this form](https://5i8caik7lja.typeform.com/psql-happy-hour) if you'd like to attend.

So if you are a Postgres fan and you are in the area, you are very welcome to join us!

### Why attend?

- **Engaging conversations**: Whether you’re a Postgres expert or curious about how Xata can elevate your next project, connect with like-minded individuals and explore new possibilities.
- **Exclusive swag**: Attendees will receive some cool Xata swag as a token of appreciation.
- **Relaxed atmosphere**: We believe the best ideas flow in a casual setting. Whether you’re diving deep into database architecture or just starting out, expect lively discussions, knowledge sharing, and maybe even a friendly debate or two.

Because talking databases is always better with a drink in hand—come network, learn, and enjoy the Postgres Happy Hour!

In the spirit of celebrating Postgres, we will be adhering to the community's [code of conduct](https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/coc/).

## Gulcin's Curated OSS Picks

The event is huge with so many sessions and events.
I will not be able to see everything, unfortunately but I made a rough plan.

### Sunday 15th

I am arriving on the 15th so first, I will go pick up my badge and you can also do so from 14:00 CEST.
Then I will try to attend [Meet Project Margo: Networking Happy Hour](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/features/co-located-events/#meet-project-margo-networking-happy-hour)
It is open to all OSS attendees.

### Monday 16th

There is a Continental Breakfast between 07:30 and 09:00 CEST, I will try to make it there.
Before breakfast there is a bus tour but it is for brave souls who do not mind waking up before 06:00 to make it to the tour on 06:45.

If you did not pick up on Sunday, you can register and pick up your badge between 07:30 - 17:00 CEST.

Then opening ceremony and keynotes start. I like the topic of Keynote: Securing the Software Commons: Standards, Automation, and AI for a Resilient Open Source Future from Abhishek Arya.
At the same time there is a keynote from Linus Torvalds, so I expect that the attendance of that one will be huge.

I then want to catch the session at 11:20 from Arun Gupta, VP and General Manager for Open Ecosystem at Intel, about Introducing Open Platform for Enterprise AI. I am personally curious about developments in the AI space and would be interested in hearing about the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) project.
There are actually two cool panel sessions colliding with this talk and if you are not so interested in the AI topic, you can search their names in the schedule:

- How to Chart Your Own Career Path in Open Source - Ildiko Vancsa, Open Infrastructure Foundation; Nithya Ruff, Amazon; Allison Randal, Capabilities Limited; and Dawn Foster, CHAOSS
- What's the State of Open Source in Europe? Key Research Findings Revealed! - Mirko Boehm, Anna Hermansen, Adrienn Lawson & Cailean Osborne, The Linux Foundation

A fun thing I discovered looking at the schedule: There is a project called Basil and the talk is delivered by what I assumed by two Italians.
So the cutest project name award goes to Basil and if you are curious what is it about search this: "Traceability and Automation Examples With Basil an Open Source Software for Quality Management - Luigi Pellecchia & Gabriele Paoloni, Red Hat"

Then there is a killer slot (12:15 CEST) with five talks I could attend, and I know it is not really helpful but here is the list:

- Demystifying Secure Application Communication with Zero Trust and Istio Without Sidecars - Lin Sun, solo.io
- Developing on Containers with Dev Containers - Hrittik Roy, Loft Labs
- Effective Strategies for Disability Inclusion in Open Source Communities - Brayan Kai Mwanyumba, OSCA Nairobi
  - I am really looking forward to this one as I am part of the Diva Conference team and we are working on strategies for disability inclusion in tech events.
- Unleashing Collective Genius: Building GenAI Through Open Collaboration - Anni Lai, Futurewei
  - Again, GenAI topic, so I am also curious about this one.
- Demystifying CNI - Writing a CNI from Scratch - Filip Nikolic, Isovalent
  - This sounds super interesting too, hard slot.

And then 14:15 session comes, with super interesting topics, schedule is too good.

- Why Both Open Source and Africa's Future Successes Are Intertwined - Peace Ojemeh, Open Source Community Africa & Ruth Ikegah, CHAOSS
  - This is a topic, I would like to hear more about. My focus is too focused on Europe and Turkey, but I am aware tech scene in Africa is booming. And this is from the abstract
    > Over the past 6 years, the African tech ecosystem has seen significant interest and participation in global open source projects through communities like Open Source Community Africa and Python groups. According to the GitHub 2023 Octoverse report, Nigeria is a hot spot for OSS adoption and technological advancement with a 45% year-over-year growth rate. This talk will explore the importance of Open Source in Africa's development and success. We will discuss Africa's current state, its challenges, and how Open Source can be used as a tool for development, innovation, and collaboration.
- Linux in Space: Fault Detection, Recovery and Fault-Tolerant System Designs - Lenka Kosková Třísková & Lukas Mazl, Technical University of Liberec & Tomas Novotny, VZLU
  - I studies my masters in Computer and Systems Engineering in Tallinn Tech University and there was a focus about Fault Detection and Fault-Tolerant System Design supported by cool subjects offered as part of our program. It left an impact on me and I am curious what is happening in this space (also literally in space hehe). And I notice the speakers are from Liberec, a city in Czech Republic, so I am cheering for them as a fellow Czech Republic resident.
- Real-time Scheduling Fault Simulation - Ben Dooks, Codethink
  - Here we go, fault simulation, also interesting.
- The Open Source AI Definition Is (Almost) Ready - Stefano Maffulli, Open Source Initiative & Justin Colannino, Microsoft
  - By now, you noticed, I am easily convinced by anything AI related.
- Why Quantum Safe Encryption Is the Next Y2K, and How to Be Prepared - Joe Winchester & Louisa Seers, IBM
  - Encryption is something I feel I can never know enough, so, added.

Now 15:25 session:

- Panel Discussion: Creating Your Community Mentorship Program - Stephanie Taylor & María Cruz, Google; Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, GitHub; and Hong Phuc Dang, FOSSASIA; & Karen Sandler, Software Freedom Conservancy
  - I thought I can learn from this, in terms of Postgres community and Women Developers of Turkey community I am part of.
- How to Train Your Dragon: An Introduction to AI Models - Fatima Sarah Khalid, GitLab
  - Yeap, I am sold.
- Who Owns This Code? Navigating Code Ownership from InnerSource to Open Source - Clare Dillon, Lero, CURIOSS & Tom Sadler, BBC
  - This is such a tricky topic and learning would not hurt.

### Tuesday 17th

Remember the folks who woke up at 06:00 to make it to the bus tour? Now, there is another opportunity to wake up early to join a 5k Fun Run!
I admire folks who can wake up early, and also can run or join bus tours. I just wish to friend them, a little motivation would be nice to be more active.

Considering I am on the booth duty, I thought I can spend the early morning at the booth.
Then I see this session at 11:00: Green Tech, Lean Budgets: A Journey to Saving Money (and the Planet) with Kubernetes - Timo Derstappen, Giant Swarm
I think, carbon footprint is something we should all think about and it is a hot topic in tech these days and I am all for greener tech!

And here goes the AI sessions:

- Generative Conversational AI Interoperability - Diego Gosmar, Open Voice Interoperability, LF AI&DATA
- Tutorial: How to Win Friends & Influence LLMs (with Prompt Engineering) - Rafael Vasquez & James Busche, IBM

// TODO: Add more sessions

### Wednesday 18th

As you can see, I felt like a kid in a candy store just by looking at the schedule. Super excited!
If you like to see all the sessions and events, you can check out the [full schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/program/schedule/).

### Conclusion

I am looking forward to seeing you at the event! If you want to get in touch, please send me an email at gulcin@xata.io.
