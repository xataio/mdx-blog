## Postgres Happy Hour with Xata at Open Source Summit Europe

On September 16-18th, we'll be at the [Open Source Summit Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/) in Vienna, Austria.

We will have a booth in the showcase area on the ground floor where we'd love to chat with you about Postgres and Xata.
Personally, this event is extra special for me, as it will be my first time doing booth duty as a new Xata employee.
If you're attending the Open Source Summit, please stop by our booth and say hello!

We are open source enthusiasts here at Xata, and here are a few of our projects:

- [pgroll](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll): An open source PostgreSQL tool for zero-downtime, reversible schema migrations.
- [pgstream](https://github.com/xataio/pgstream): An open source change data capture (CDC) command-line tool and library for Postgres.
- [pgzx](https://github.com/xataio/pgzx): An open source framework to easily build PostgreSQL extensions in Zig, a systems programming language for maintainable and fast code.

If you'd like to set up a time to chat about anything related to Postgres, Xata, or open source in general, feel free to email me at gulcin@xata.io.

## Join us for the Postgres Happy Hour!

It is not only booth duty, but I am happy to announce that we'll be also hosting a [Postgres Happy Hour at the Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/features/co-located-events/#postgres-happy-hour-with-xata) on September 18th!

At Xata, we are passionate about PostgreSQL and its role in powering modern applications.
We believe that PostgreSQL is more than just a database; it is a fundamental technology that enables innovation and growth in the tech industry.
And we are excited to celebrate this awesome project with the Postgres community at the Open Source Summit Europe!

The event is free and open to everyone, even if you are not attending the Open Source Summit.
However, space is limited to 50 attendees, so please fill out[this form](https://5i8caik7lja.typeform.com/psql-happy-hour) if you'd like to attend.

If you're a Postgres fan and in the area, you're very welcome to join us!

### Why attend?

- **Engaging conversations**: Whether you‚Äôre a Postgres expert or curious about how Xata can elevate your next project, connect with like-minded individuals and explore new possibilities.
- **Exclusive swag**: Attendees will receive some cool Xata swag as a token of appreciation.
- **Relaxed atmosphere**: We believe the best ideas flow in a casual setting. Whether you‚Äôre diving deep into database architecture or just starting out, expect lively discussions, knowledge sharing, and maybe even a friendly debate or two.

Because talking databases is always better with a drink in hand‚Äîcome network, learn, and enjoy the Postgres Happy Hour!

In the spirit of celebrating Postgres, we will be adhering to the community's [code of conduct](https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/coc/).

### A Personal Postgres Story

When we were planning the Postgres Happy Hour in Vienna, I realized that it was almost 9 years ago, around the same time of year, that I gave my first PGConf.EU talk in Vienna.
I was overwhelmed by the size of the room and how crowded it felt, despite its spaciousness. It was my first Postgres talk in English, and delivering it at the biggest Postgres conference was terrifying.
The talk was about [Managing Postgres with Ansible](https://slides.com/apatheticmagpie/managing-postgres-with-ansible), which was a cool topic at the time. I remember making so many slides and forgetting to breathe. No other talk seemed so hard after that‚Äîit was a big learning experience.

Now, almost a decade later, I am so happy to have the chance to celebrate Postgres and the community that made me feel welcome and supported, even with my 70-page-long slides! üòä

## Gulcin's Curated OSS Picks

The event is huge with so many sessions and events.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to see everything, but I made a rough plan.
Let me know if you are giving a talk and want me to cheer for you! I'm always happy to support a fellow speaker!

Besides the talk sessions I plan to attend, I will also visit the booths and talk to the community.
One booth I'm particularly excited to visit is the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) booth. They were kind enough to send an introductory email, and I plan to visit them in person.

### Sunday 15th

I am arriving on the 15th so first, I will go pick up my badge and you can also do so from 14:00 CEST.
Then I will try to attend Meet Project Margo: Networking Happy Hour. It is open to all OSS attendees.

### Monday 16th

There is a Continental Breakfast between 07:30 and 09:00 CEST, I will try to make it there.
Before breakfast there is a bus tour but it is for brave souls who do not mind waking up before 06:00 to make it to the tour on 06:45.

If you did not pick up on Sunday, you can register and pick up your badge between 07:30 - 17:00 CEST.

Then opening ceremony and keynotes start. I like the topic of Keynote: Securing the Software Commons: Standards, Automation, and AI for a Resilient Open Source Future from Abhishek Arya.
At the same time there is a keynote from Linus Torvalds, so I expect that the attendance of that one will be huge.

I then want to catch the session at 11:20 from Arun Gupta, VP and General Manager for Open Ecosystem at Intel, about Introducing Open Platform for Enterprise AI. I am personally curious about developments in the AI space and would be interested in hearing about the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA) project.
There are actually two cool panel sessions colliding with this talk and if you are not so interested in the AI topic, you can search their names in the schedule:

- How to Chart Your Own Career Path in Open Source - Ildiko Vancsa, Open Infrastructure Foundation; Nithya Ruff, Amazon; Allison Randal, Capabilities Limited; and Dawn Foster, CHAOSS
- What's the State of Open Source in Europe? Key Research Findings Revealed! - Mirko Boehm, Anna Hermansen, Adrienn Lawson & Cailean Osborne, The Linux Foundation

A fun thing I discovered looking at the schedule: There is a project called Basil and the talk is delivered by what I assumed by two Italians.
So the cutest project name award goes to Basil and if you are curious what is it about search this: "Traceability and Automation Examples With Basil an Open Source Software for Quality Management - Luigi Pellecchia & Gabriele Paoloni, Red Hat"

Then there is a killer slot (12:15 CEST) with five talks I could attend, and I know it is not really helpful but here is the list:

- Demystifying Secure Application Communication with Zero Trust and Istio Without Sidecars - Lin Sun, solo.io
- Developing on Containers with Dev Containers - Hrittik Roy, Loft Labs
- Effective Strategies for Disability Inclusion in Open Source Communities - Brayan Kai Mwanyumba, OSCA Nairobi
  - _I am really looking forward to this one as I am part of the Diva Conference team and we are working on strategies for disability inclusion in tech events. I am cheering for them as a fellow Czech Republic resident._
- Unleashing Collective Genius: Building GenAI Through Open Collaboration - Anni Lai, Futurewei
  - _Again, GenAI topic, so I am also curious about this one._
- Demystifying CNI - Writing a CNI from Scratch - Filip Nikolic, Isovalent
  - _This sounds super interesting too, hard slot._

And then 14:15 session comes, with super interesting topics, schedule is too good.

- Why Both Open Source and Africa's Future Successes Are Intertwined - Peace Ojemeh, Open Source Community Africa & Ruth Ikegah, CHAOSS
  - _This is a topic I would like to hear more about. My focus is too focused on Europe and Turkey, but I am aware tech scene in Africa is booming. And this is from the abstract_
    > Over the past 6 years, the African tech ecosystem has seen significant interest and participation in global open source projects through communities like Open Source Community Africa and Python groups. According to the GitHub 2023 Octoverse report, Nigeria is a hot spot for OSS adoption and technological advancement with a 45% year-over-year growth rate. This talk will explore the importance of Open Source in Africa's development and success. We will discuss Africa's current state, its challenges, and how Open Source can be used as a tool for development, innovation, and collaboration.
- Linux in Space: Fault Detection, Recovery and Fault-Tolerant System Designs - Lenka Koskov√° T≈ô√≠skov√° & Lukas Mazl, Technical University of Liberec & Tomas Novotny, VZLU
  - _I studied my masters in Computer and Systems Engineering in Tallinn Tech University and there was a focus about Fault Detection and Fault-Tolerant System Design supported by cool subjects offered as part of our program. It left an impact on me and I am curious what is happening in this space (also literally in space hehe). I even gave talk in FOSDEM Postgres Devroom in 2017 about [Evolution of Fault Tolerance in Postgres](https://slides.com/apatheticmagpie/ft-in-postgres-fosdem). You can watch a younger me speaking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3wQ5DBVaQk). Another bonus point, I notice the speakers are from Liberec, a city in Czech Republic, so I am cheering for them as a fellow Czech Republic resident._
- Real-time Scheduling Fault Simulation - Ben Dooks, Codethink
  - _Here we go, fault simulation, also interesting._
- The Open Source AI Definition Is (Almost) Ready - Stefano Maffulli, Open Source Initiative & Justin Colannino, Microsoft
  - _By now, you noticed, I am easily convinced by anything AI related._
- Why Quantum Safe Encryption Is the Next Y2K, and How to Be Prepared - Joe Winchester & Louisa Seers, IBM
  - _Encryption is something I feel I can never know enough, so, added._

Now 15:25 session:

- Panel Discussion: Creating Your Community Mentorship Program - Stephanie Taylor & Mar√≠a Cruz, Google; Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, GitHub; and Hong Phuc Dang, FOSSASIA; & Karen Sandler, Software Freedom Conservancy
  - _I thought I can learn from this, in terms of Postgres community and Women Developers of Turkey community I am part of._
- How to Train Your Dragon: An Introduction to AI Models - Fatima Sarah Khalid, GitLab
  - _Yeap, I am sold._
- Who Owns This Code? Navigating Code Ownership from InnerSource to Open Source - Clare Dillon, Lero, CURIOSS & Tom Sadler, BBC
  - _This is such a tricky topic and learning would not hurt._

16:20 session:

- The Power of Mentorship: Your Path to Open Source Success - Stephanie Taylor, Google
  - _I don't think I ever got a formal mentorship but informally I can point out some people who were crucial for my career. I think I am also probably informally, helped out some people myself through the communities I am part of. Recently I found myself thinking about if I could benefit from a mentor myself and how would that person look like, so this is interesting._

If I could make it to some (hopefully the most) of these, I would surely be done and probably happy to end the day.

### Tuesday 17th

Remember the folks who woke up at 06:00 to make it to the bus tour? Now, there is another opportunity to wake up early to join a 5k Fun Run!
I admire folks who can wake up early, and also can run or join bus tours. I just wish to friend them, a little motivation would be nice to be more active.

Considering I am on the booth duty, I thought I can spend the early morning at the booth.
Then I see this session at 11:00: Green Tech, Lean Budgets: A Journey to Saving Money (and the Planet) with Kubernetes - Timo Derstappen, Giant Swarm
I think, carbon footprint is something we should all think about and it is a hot topic in tech these days and I am all for greener tech!

And here goes the AI sessions at 11:00:

- Generative Conversational AI Interoperability - Diego Gosmar, Open Voice Interoperability, LF AI&DATA
- Tutorial: How to Win Friends & Influence LLMs (with Prompt Engineering) - Rafael Vasquez & James Busche, IBM

Here is my selection for 11:55:

- Dude, Where‚Äôs My Error?: How OpenTelemetry Records Errors, and Why It Does It Like That - Adriana Villela, ServiceNow Cloud Observability & Reese Lee, New Relic
  - _Error handling is interesting topic for me, and the abstract piqued my interest._
    > When an app crashes or throws an exception, these errors are not just useful, but vital, to record. However: _ How an error is visualized in a backend may not be where you think it‚Äôll be, or how you expect it to look. _ Only looking at errors could mean you‚Äôre missing out on understanding your system holistically, including other failures that may be causing user dissatisfaction.
- Sponsored Session: Confidential Computing - New Capabilities for New Workloads - Mike Bursell, Confidential Computing Consortium
  - _In the abstract they mention hardware-based security, I wonder what is new in this area._
- Linux Sandboxing with Landlock - Micka√´l Sala√ºn, Microsoft
  - _Abstract seemed interesting, and so does the topic._
    > Landlock's goal is to make it possible for Linux applications to sandbox themselves. On Linux, many traditional access control mechanisms are only available to the system administrator, which do not follow the principle of least privilege. As a result, sandboxing policies were created independently of an actual program execution, leading to unnecessarily broad policies. With Landlock, unprivileged processes can safely create sandboxing policies well-tailored to the expected needs of a running application. Landlock also solves the organizational aspect of keeping policy and software in sync with each other, by putting the policy definition and maintenance in the developer's hands. In this talk, we explain how Landlock works and how it can be used to protect Linux users, without being noticed, except by attackers.
- Simplifying Generative AI App Development: Why Standards Matter - Katherine Druckman & Ezequiel Lanza, Intel
  - _Standards and AI, double interesting._

For lunch, I am really looking forward to attend the **Better Together Diversity Luncheon**. It takes place between 12:35 and 14:00. The lunch is at Wolke21, a 5-minute walk from the venue. It's on the 21st level of the Saturn Tower. There is a map on the event page.

I've came across the sessions below for 14:00 and hopefully will catch one after lunch:

- Inspecting and Optimizing Memory Usage in Linux - Jo√£o Marcos Costa, Bootlin
  - _Another topic, I find always interesting, memory usage. So why not?_
- Surviving 19 Jan 2038 on 32 Bit Platforms: Lessons Learned and Common Problems - Alexander Kanavin, Linutronix
  - _Who would not find yet another world doomsday interesting?_
- Milvus: Scaling Vector Data Solutions with Gen AI - Stephen Batifol, Zilliz
  - _Vector databases, here I come!_
- Planning for Retirement: How Can We Prepare for Software‚Äôs End-of-Life/End-of-Support Date? - Victoria Ontiveros, CISA & Justin Murphy, DHS/CISA
  - _I cannot plan for my own retirement, but I can plan for the software I use, so let's learn about it._

Here comes sessions at 16:00:

- Panel Discussion: Outreachy Linux Kernel Internship Report - Julia Lawall, Inria; Hans Verkuil, Cisco Systems Norway; Tahera Fahimi, University of Calgary; Khadija Kamran; and Dorcas Litunya, Jomo Kenyatta University
- You Never Know When You Need a Fork - Madelyn Olson, AWS & Viktor S√∂derqvist, Ericsson
  - _Licensing wars are on, we are all in the trenches. Added the abstract below_
    > What happens when a beloved open-source project used by millions of developers suddenly changes to a non-open source license? In this session learn about what lead to the creation of Valkey, the open-source alternative to the now proprietary Redis project. In this talk, two Valkey maintainers will discuss how Valkey was created and the lessons learned along the way. We'll discuss the concerns that existed in our community before the fork, the challenges we faced during the creation of the new project, and where we want to take Valkey in the future.

I assume by this time I would be getting a little tired so these are my last sessions at 16:55:

- Taming DMA: Tales Wrestling Memory Corruption - Ahmad Fatoum, Pengutronix
  - _Memory corruption, music to my ears._
- Reducing Bias in AI with Open Source - Abubakar Siddiq Ango, GitLab
  - _We are all biased and systems humans create are biased too. Learning more about how to reduce bias in AI is a must._

Then I plan to attend the Attendee Reception. Here is the description:

> Join us for a memorable evening at Prater Alm in Vienna, where tradition meets modern charm. Nestled in the heart of the Prater park, this rustic alpine lodge offers a warm and inviting atmosphere. Enjoy authentic Austrian cuisine, lively music, and the opportunity to network with fellow conference attendees. This event promises a delightful blend of culture, cuisine, and camaraderie, making it a highlight of your Vienna experience.

### Wednesday 18th

Hello, early birds, you probably did the bus tour, and ran 5k yesterday, and now you can do morning yoga at 06:45. Nameste!
Jokes aside, this is suuuper-early activity I can perhaps convince myself to attend. I will depend how much I enjoyed the reception the previous day.

My agenda for Wednesday is not so tight, I can afford to be flexible and go with the flow, or be a nicer colleague and do more booth duty!

But a few sessions have caught my eye:

- 11:00 Next-Gen Documentation with AI - Hema Veeradhi, Red Hat
  - _I am always looking for ways to improve documentation and this is right up my alley._
- 11:55 Panel: Why Open Source AI Matters for Europe - Justin Colannino, Microsoft; Sachiko Muto, OpenForum Europe; Stefano Maffulli, Open Source Initiative; Cailean Osborne, The Linux Foundation
  - _As a fellow Europe resident, this is a topic that will personally affect me and I would like to learn more about it._

For lunch this time, I would be joining the **Women and Non-Binary Lunch** at 12:35 and then I plan to do some more booth duty and try to control my excitement until the Postgres Happy Hour!

And finally, the event I look forward to the most: (drumroll) **Postgres Happy Hour with Xata at 17:00!**
I don't need to say more, right? What makes a community is the people in it, I hope we can make some new friends and see some old ones!

## Conclusion
