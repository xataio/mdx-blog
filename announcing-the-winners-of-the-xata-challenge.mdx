Late last year, we launched the [Xata Challenge](https://twitter.com/xata/status/1600186056942489600) to challenge our community to build that app that’s been itching at them all year. We were so excited to see the engagement from our community and all of the amazing submissions. The deadlines for submissions have now passed and we’re thrilled to announce the winners of the first ever Xata Challenge! There were many great submissions, here are the top three as voted by the Xata team.

🥁 _Drum roll, please_ 🥁

And the three winners, as voted by the [Xata team](https://xata.io/about), are…

Repository: [github.com/ishaanbedi/ishn.xyz](https://github.com/ishaanbedi/ishn.xyz)

URL: [ishn.xyz](https://www.ishn.xyz/)

ishn.xyz is a fast, feature-rich and completely free link shortener. It has features like custom slugs, statistical tracking, QR Code generation and instant sharing. The Xata team really liked how simple and easy to use this solution was, and that an API was also part of the offering itself. We're really excited to see where Ishaan takes this product suite next.

## Thoughtnaut

URL: [thoughtnaut.io](https://www.thoughtnaut.io/)

Thoughtnaut is a journaling companion that will explore your mind and help you find clarity. The Xata team found Justin's app to be incredibly unique and makes it easy to take a step back and self reflect. Thoughtnaut is already a favorite amongst Xataflies and is fueling journals across the team.

## Apprendamos

URL: [apprendamos.com](https://apprendamos.com/home)

Apprendamos is a social networking platform where people can share articles and interact with others on the network. We were excited to see the first social networking platform built on Xata and the complexity involved with the implementation itself. Not to mention, It's use case we're currently handling in our #random slack channel. It'll be nice to have something a bit more tailored to our article sharing moving forward.

Congratulations to all our winners who will receive a $500 cash prize and our participants who will be receiving some one of a kind Xata swag! 🍾 🎉 🦋

If you missed out on the Xata challenge this time around, don't worry. We'll be hosting another one soon. In the meantime if you'd like to showcase what you've built on Xata, come share with us on [Discord](https://xata.io/discord).
