Towards the end of 2023, we announced our annual [Holiday Hackathon](https://xata.io/blog/xata-holiday-hackathon) to challenge our community to build that app they've been putting off all year. We were so excited to see the engagement from our community and all of the amazing submissions. The deadlines for submissions have now passed and we‚Äôre thrilled to announce the winners of the Holiday Hackathon!

ü•Å _Drum roll, please_ ü•Å

And the five winners (in no particular order), as voted by the [Xata team](https://xata.io/about), are‚Ä¶

## UTEC Classrooms

Developed by Anthony Cueva, a student at Universidad de Ingenier√≠a y Tecnolog√≠a (UTEC), UTEC Classrooms is an intuitive tool that simplifies the process of finding available classrooms on campus. Hopefully Anthony and his fellow students can put this to good use!
