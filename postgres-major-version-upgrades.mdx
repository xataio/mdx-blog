One of the challenges of running a Postgres database is upgrading to a new major version. Major version
upgrades can introduce new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes, but they can also be complex
and time-consuming. Common issues with major Postgres upgrades are:

- **Complex orchestration**: Orchestrating a migration is a multi-step process that requires careful planning, with little room
  for errors.
- **Downtime**: Planned (and unplanned) downtime is not uncommon when a major version upgrade happens, impacting users and business.
- **Clients config changes**: Not only the infra part, in many cases also client apps also need to be aware of the migration and
  update their database connection details to point to a new host once a migration is done.

For all these reasons, major version upgrades are often postponed and become a major event across multiple engineering teams.

### Branch moving in Xata

Today, we are launching branch moving, which allows Xata users to move a branch between two Postgres clusters while it's being
accessed. You can use this as a way to move a branch from a shared cluster in our free tier to your own dedicated cluster, for better
performance & isolation.

This feature also allows to perform near zero-downtime major Postgres version upgrades by moving a branch between two clusters running
on different versions.
