[Parker Dinkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-parker-dinkins/), is a young entrepreneur out of Florida. As a self taught developer, he initially founded a startup with some friends back in 2022 called Precision Ecology. It was a digital mapping data solutions company focused on providing data for sustainable development and environmental management. They were flying a [Wingtra](https://wingtra.com/) drone collecting aerial images across large amounts of acreage and Parker was responsible for the processing of the data. This is where he fell in love with geospatial data and GIS.

After Precision Ecology didnâ€™t pan out, he decided to go back to to school and study Environmental Studies to focus on GIS. So what does he do when heâ€™s a student back at school? Launch another startup of course.

## Maps, for the people

If youâ€™re unfamiliar with the GIS world, it is full of disparate data sets, layers, shapes, and point files. Every industry, agency, and region tends to have its own collection of open-source assets available for download and use. This is great because the data is accessible, but navigating through various web entities to find what youâ€™re looking for can be a bit of a pain.

Cue [OpenSourceGISData.com](http://OpenSourceGISData.com) (OSGD), Parker's latest venture. OSGD is a website that contains geoportals and ArcREST servers for all the major federal agencies, states, counties, and cities. After seeing some popularity on Reddit and healthy daily traffic, he feels he scratched an itch for geospatial professionals.

About a year after launching the OSGD website, he officially launched a sister search engine [GISData](https://gisdata.io/). GISData has indexed over 740,000 layers from 1,700 different sources and counting. The goal was to provide a single source of truth where users can search across all disparate data sources. And so far, itâ€™s proven to be a hit.

## An evolving architecture for geospatial data search

Balancing straight Aâ€™s at the University of Central Florida with a budding startup is no easy task, but some how Parker is managing it just fine.

In the initial release of the search engine, Parker was pushing CSV directly to the client and used JavaScript code to search against it. This lead to many issues with timeouts and lag, and the search took a long time. He was OK with this, but knew he wanted to get the initial release out quickly given the interest from the GIS community.

For a while, he tried [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), but got lost in their documentation and struggled to implement full-text search for his use case. After a bit more searching (no pun intended), he discovered Xata as an alternative to MongoDB. Paired with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), he was able to build out the initial powerful geospatial data search experience in a day. Since then, itâ€™s been very easy to continue to iterate and focus on the pipeline with an ever-growing data set.

The search behind GISData is built on a modern technology stack. Itâ€™s currently using [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) for orchestration, Python for indexing scripts, Xata as the database, JavaScript and [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) for the frontend and Vercel for application deployment. This stack is optimized for speed and minimal operational maintenance.

## Just getting started

Parker has a larger vision for this platform beyond the GISData search engine. Heâ€™s planning to roll out a free and paid version of the [GIS API](https://docs.gisapi.io/) that enables developers to integrate geospatial data discovery into their own applications. For less technical users, heâ€™s aiming to a create a simple mapping platform where users with little to no experience can find data and create simple maps for their own personal use case. We also discussed the possibility of introducing an AI geo assistant, which is another avenue of monetization. While heâ€™ll likely be focusing on the next few months on foundational elements to support those features, thereâ€™s a bright future ahead for the [Omniverse.xyz](https://Omniverse.XYZ) GIS platform.

## Feedback and feature requests

After talking about whatâ€™s on the horizon, we asked Parker to share some of his favorite parts about Xata and where he thinks we can improve. Here are some of the reasons why Parker chose Xata for his application:

- **Reducing time to market**. The simplicity and developer experience Xata provided significantly reduced the time it took to take the GISData search implementation to production.
- **Zero database management.** Databases can be tricky and complex. Because Xata is serverless, there is zero-ops needed.
- **More intelligent search.** Parker is interested in using the Xata [`ask` endpoint](https://xata.io/docs/sdk/ask) to augment his current search experience with chat like experiences.

When asked what heâ€™d like to see from Xata, hereâ€™s what Parker shared:

- **Dagster integration.** Using Dagster for orchestration, heâ€™d love to see a [native integration](https://xata.canny.io/feature-requests/p/dagster-guide-or-integration) similar to [Airbyte](https://xata.io/docs/integrations/airbyte).
- **URL rich data type.** While he currently has URLs stored as strings, it would be useful to have a data type that stores URLs and checks their validity.
