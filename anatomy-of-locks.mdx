## Art of Locking or Unlocking?

It is normal to think about database locks and go into physical-world lock analogies, and maybe order three books about the history of locks, Persian locks, and lock-picking techniques.
Probably most of us learn by going deeper into the term “locking” to understand a concept in PostgreSQL that doesn’t really have much to do with physical-world locks, as physical locks are mostly about security.
In the case of Postgres, though, it is all about concurrency and controlling which transaction can hold a lock while another transaction can do its thing and ideally without ever blocking each other.
But as we know, no world is ideal, whether it’s a door lock or an `AccessShareLock`.

However, now that I’ve bought those said books about locks, I think I should be allowed to draw some parallels between, let’s say, the art of lock-picking and database locking mechanisms.
There is one thing I will start with: to be able to pick a lock, any type of lock, you need to have a deep understanding of its inner workings; how the pins, tumbler, and mechanisms interact.
By manipulating them, you can find the correct position to unlock the door or safe without a key!
In the same way, to be able to manage database locks, you need to understand the internal workings of a database, and mainly how concurrency works in Postgres.
