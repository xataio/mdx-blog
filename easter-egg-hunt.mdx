As part of our launch week, for a chance to win one of five [Meta Quest 3 Headsets](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/), we will be hiding an Easter egg **each day** across the Xata website or community channels for you to find, with a riddle to solve. There are five Easter eggs in total, with the egg of the day presented daily on our [launch week landing page](https://xata.io/launch-week-unleash-the-elephant).
