## What do I look forward to at PGConf.EU in Athens? üîç

PGConf.EU holds a special place in my heart. I gave my first English talk at the event in Vienna back in 2015, which was only my second time abroad for a conference after FOSDEM that same year.
From that moment, I felt a strong sense of belonging and made a personal commitment to attend as many Postgres conferences as possible.
Thankfully, I‚Äôve been supported in this mission by the companies I‚Äôve worked for over the years.

Since then, I‚Äôve made lifelong friends, some of whom feel like family, and I‚Äôve had the opportunity to give many talks and organize more conferences along the way.

![Speakers photo from Vienna, 2015. I am the third person from the right, front.](/images/pgconfeu-2024/gulcin-pgconfeu-2015.jpg)

I've also had the privilege of organizing, speaking at, or attending two conferences in the cities I‚Äôve lived in.
PGConf.EU came to Tallinn in 2016 while I was pursuing my Master's there and working remotely for 2ndQuadrant.
That remains one of my favorite conferences to date, and in my opinion, we had the best conference party ever!
But as we all know, party photos are best kept private so here‚Äôs the official speakersÔøΩÔøΩ photo instead! üòÑ

![Speakers photo from Tallinn, 2016. I am in the middle holding two gift bags.](/images/pgconfeu-2024/gulcin-pgconfeu-2016.jpg)

Fast-forward to 2023, and PGConf.EU came to Prague, the city I now call home! In 2022, I had planned to attend the Berlin conference, but I broke my toe right before it, and that little mishap kept me from going.
Thankfully, last year‚Äôs event was local, and all my toes were intact! üòÑ

## A few words about PGConf.EU 2023 in Prague

Last year in Prague, over 700 Postgres enthusiasts gathered just before Christmas. It was amazing to reconnect in person, share our passion for Postgres, and catch up on life in general!

This year, for Athens, we‚Äôve already surpassed 700 attendees and the numbers are still climbing! Huge thanks to the organizers and staff who have worked tirelessly to make this event possible.

### Daycare in the conference venue

Last year‚Äôs PGConf.EU was special for me because it was the first time my daughter attended the conference with me. She had an absolute blast! At one point, she told me, "Mommy, I keep meeting new people!" which perfectly captured the exciting and sometimes overwhelming energy of a conference full of conversations and connections. Many of my friends met her for the first time, and they showered her with gifts, making her feel truly special ‚ù§.

A big thank you to all the booth staff as well! She visited every booth and collected all kinds of treasures‚Äîwooden puzzles, activity books, squeezy hippos, rubber ducks, Christmas tree ornaments, bouncy balls, stickers, and sweets. She was running around, chatting with everyone, and enjoying the tasty food. Speaking of which, the food last year was really delicious‚Äîa big thumbs up for that too!

![She is telling her new rubber duck to stay still on her new wooden boat. Thanks for the gifts √Ålvaro!](/images/pgconfeu-2024/aida-duck-boat.jpg)

Fun fact: We found out I was pregnant with her at PGConf.EU 2018 in Lisbon, so technically, she was there with us, just not born yet! But we won‚Äôt count that as her first PGConf üòÑ.

I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to the organizers for providing daycare at the venue last year. It was a game-changer, allowing me to bring her along. It's a fantastic step towards making the Postgres community more inclusive for parents. However, due to low demand, there won‚Äôt be daycare at the venue this year. But I‚Äôm proud of the community for striving toward better standards of inclusivity, and I hope this option returns in the future.

### Barbie talk

In Prague, I knew if I ever mention a talk from the event, that would be "Trying to be Barbie in Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House" presented by two wonderful women Karen Jex and L√¶titia AVROT.

![Postgres Barbies, 2023 Prague](/images/pgconfeu-2024/postgres-barbies-2023.jpg)

In my view, this was a pivotal moment in the history of the Postgres community.
As the photos earlier in the post show, our community, like much of the tech industry, is predominantly male.
Delivering a talk that highlights the biases faced by underrepresented groups in tech, and discussing how we can improve as a community and as individuals, was a major step forward.
Having this conversation openly, in a room full of people, is a powerful move toward a more inclusive future.

## Let's talk about PGConf.EU 2024

PGConf.EU is the event I am the most excited about among all the Postgres conferences I attend the whole year!

### Program Committee

This year, I will put on many hats, as I have done in previous years. One of them is being a member of [Program Committee](https://2024.pgconf.eu/organisation/).
Creating an event schedule is a challenging task, not only due to the sheer number of talks and speakers but to find a balance between different topics and experience levels.
That's why there were 6 of us this year to review the talks and create the schedule and hopefully we did a good job, see the full schedule [here](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/).

### Postgres Europe Diversity Committee

Another exciting thing I am part of is the [Postgres Europe Diversity Committee](https://www.postgresql.eu/diversity/).

As you can see from the conference photos I shared from 2015 and 2016, there were only a few women who gave talks, 4 or 5 at most, confirmed with event schedule.
And probably fewer Postgres contributors. It is clear that the Barbie photo from the last year showed there is indeed an improvement, but we still have a long way to go.

I am a firm believer of investing in diversity and inclusion initiatives. And it is usually a long-term investment. First, you need to bring people in, invite them to conferences,
support them with travel funds, donate conference tickets, make sure they will feel safe and welcome when they join the conferences and eventually feel confident to give talks.
After that, some of them will become active contributors to the community, some will be interested in helping with those conferences, some will become Postgres committers.

Having a community that is inclusive makes things better for everyone, not only for the underrepresented groups.
For this reason, I've recently joined newly forming [Postgres Europe Diversity Committee](https://www.postgresql.eu/diversity/) and we will have our first meeting in Athens on 22nd October.
We have a lot of plans and initiatives to make the Postgres community more inclusive and diverse and I am happy to be part of it.

### Extension Ecosystem Summit

Day 0 of the PGConf.EU is the busiest for me. Right after the Diversity Committee meeting, I will be joining the Extension Ecosystem Summit.
It is a truly collaborative event organized by Tembo (thanks Floor!) and Xata is one of the sponsors.

The summit will be a great opportunity to meet other extension developers, share ideas, and collaborate on shared goals.
I will be presenting [pgzx](https://github.com/xataio/pgzx), an open-source library for developing PostgreSQL extensions written in Zig, developed at Xata.
