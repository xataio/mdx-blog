We’re excited to kick off [Postgres Cafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwaJd2c9whM), a blog and video series from Xata in collaboration with [Data Bene](https://www.data-bene.io/en/), where we dive into innovative open-source tools for Postgres. Each episode highlights a new tool designed to make working with Postgres databases easier and more efficient.
In this first episode, we explore [pgroll](https://pgroll.com/), our tool for achieving zero-downtime database schema changes, and the solutions it provides to common database migration challenges.

# Episode 1: pgroll

Schema changes are often challenging, especially for production databases where downtime is not an option. In this episode, we discuss pgroll, a tool designed to tackle these challenges with an approach that prioritizes reliability and uptime. Here’s a look at what this episode covered:

## Key challenges in schema changes

Schema changes can lead to various issues, particularly around:

- **Schema debt:** Development teams often accrue “schema debt” over time, adding rather than modifying fields to avoid risky changes. This buildup can lead to cluttered schemas that impact performance and maintainability.
- **Exclusive locks:** Many schema changes in Postgres require exclusive locks, which can block reads and writes, risking significant downtime. pgroll’s approach helps minimize these locks, keeping applications responsive during migrations.
- **Rollback complexity:** Rollbacks are often tricky and rarely tested, especially when schema changes can’t be easily undone. pgroll addresses this with a pattern that simplifies reverting changes without application downtime.

## pgroll’s approach: automating expand-contract

The [expand-contract pattern](https://xata.io/blog/pgroll-expand-contract) is a safe and reliable approach for schema migrations. pgroll automates this multi-step process by:

- Using **triggers to enable dual writes**, allowing applications to continue working with both old and new schema versions.
- Offering **schema version views** so applications can connect to the specific schema version they need, enabling zero-downtime alterations.
- Supporting the ability to **pause in the “expand” phase**, giving teams flexibility to test changes before finalizing.

pgroll provides a practical solution to the most pressing migration challenges, reducing downtime and making complex changes more manageable for developers.
