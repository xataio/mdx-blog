As our [launch week](/blog/launch-week-august-2023) comes to a close, we're looking at APIs and their intricate relationships. Today, we're introducing a new syntax that simplifies navigating these relationships. While Xata already provides a great way to retrieve related data using [link columns](/docs/concepts/data-model#link) for the _many-to-one_ relationship, we're addressing the challenge of navigating the reverse [relationship](/docs/concepts/data-model#links-and-relations) (_one-to-many_). This new approach improves efficiency and helps avoid the _N + 1 problem_.

Let's consider a basic schema. Within the schema, there's a _Posts_ table containing certain information and establishing a connection to the corresponding author. This author-related data belongs in the _Users_ table.

When querying the _Posts_ table we are able to retrieve the title, likes, and the author's name (and any other fields present in the _Users_ table):

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const records = await xata.db.posts
    .select(["*", "author.*"])
    .getAll();
```

```python
records = xata.data().query("posts", {
  "columns": ["*","author.*"]
})
```

```jsonc
// POST /db/blogs:main/tables/posts/query
{
  "columns": ["*", "author.*"]
}
```

</TabbedCode>

```jsonc
// Response (xata fields have been omitted for clarity)
{
  "records": [
    {
      "author": {
        "id": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0",
        "name": "Tudor Golubenco"
      },

        "name": "Alex Francoeur"
      },

      "likes": 20,
      "title": "Modern database workflows with GitHub, Vercel, Netlify, and Xata"
    }
  ]
}
```

## The N + 1 problem

What if we wanted to list the authors and their posts? You would need to query the _Users_ table in order to retrieve all authors:

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const records = await xata.db.users
    .select(["*"])
    .getAll();
```
```python
records = xata.data().query("posts", {
  "columns": ["*"]
})
```
```jsonc
// POST /db/blogs:main/tables/users/query
{
  "columns": ["*"]
}
```
</TabbedCode>

```jsonc
// Response (Xata fields have been omitted for clarity)
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0",
      "name": "Tudor Golubenco"
    },
    {
      "id": "rec_cie05ljjtojbm41fv2qg",
      "name": "Joan Edwards"
    },
    {
      "id": "rec_cii1ki3jtoj0t82ae3b0",
      "name": "Alex Francoeur"
    }
  ]
}
```

And then, for each user that has been returned, make a separate request in the _Posts_ table to retrieve the posts from each author, similar to:

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const records = await xata.db.posts
    .select(["*"])
    .filter({ author: "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0"})
    .getAll();
```
```python
records = xata.data().query("posts", {
  "columns": ["*"],
  "filter": {
    "author": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0"
  }
})
```
```jsonc
// POST /db/blogs:main/tables/posts/query
{
  "columns": ["*"],
  "filter": {
    "author": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0"
  }
}
```
</TabbedCode>

```jsonc
// Response (Xata fields have been omitted for clarity)
{
  "records": [
    {
      "author": {
        "id": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0"
      },
      "id": "rec_cie05srjtojbm41fv2t0",
      "likes": 13,
      "title": "Postgres schema changes are still a PITA"
    },
    {
      "author": {
        "id": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0"
      },
      "id": "rec_cie05v3jtojbm41fv2tg",
      "likes": 15,
      "title": "On the performance impact of REPLICA IDENTITY FULL in Postgres"
    },
    {
      "author": {
        "id": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0"
      },
      "id": "rec_cii1kajjtoj0t82ae3ag",
      "likes": 6,
      "title": "Semantic or keyword search for finding ChatGPT context. Who searched it better?"
    }
  ]
}
```

We are performing "1" (get the authors) + "N" (get the authors's posts) requests. This is inconvenient and also quite inefficient, since the number of requests depends on the number of user records.

There are workarounds depending on the data set and the amount of code we are willing to write, like getting all the authors and all the posts, or using the `IN` operator and then processing the response in the app. But it would be better if our API helped us get exactly what we want.

## Navigate links backwards

Since the relationship is already defined by the `link` column, it’s a matter of providing a good API experience to get this data more easily. We have introduced [column expressions](/docs/concepts/data-model#links-and-relations) in the query endpoint so the `columns` field is no longer restricted to a list of column names. Now we are able to provide a JSON object to better define the projection we want.

To better understand this concept, let's improve on the previous example to showcase the benefits of navigating relationships in reverse using column expressions:

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const records = await xata.db.users
    .select(["*", {
        "name": "<-posts.author",
        "columns": ["title"]
    }])
    .getAll();
```
```python
records = xata.data().query("posts", {
  "columns": [
    "*",
    {
      "name": "<-posts.author",
      "columns": ["title"]
    }
  ]
})
```
```jsonc
// POST /db/blogs:main/tables/users/query
{
  "columns": [
    "*",
    {
      "name": "<-posts.author",
      "columns": ["title"]
    }
  ]
}
```
</TabbedCode>

In this request we are asking for all the fields in the _Users_ table (`*`) plus a column expression. The expression consists of a structure with two fields:

- `name`: When using the `<-` prefix, it signifies that we are navigating in reverse along the link defined by the `author` column in the _Posts_ table. This reverse navigation establishes a one-to-many relationship between the linked records.

- `columns`: The `columns` field defines the projection to be applied to the table on the opposite side of this relationship. It specifies which fields from the related table should be included in the query result.

What we get back is a list of post data nested in every author record. The default name for the nested list is `postsauthor` (i.e. table name + link name):

```jsonc
// Response (xata fields have been omitted for clarity)
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0",
      "name": "Tudor Golubenco",
      "postsauthor": {
        "records": [
          {
            "id": "rec_cie05srjtojbm41fv2t0",
            "title": "Postgres schema changes are still a PITA"
          },
          {
            "id": "rec_cie05v3jtojbm41fv2tg",
            "title": "On the performance impact of REPLICA IDENTITY FULL in Postgres"
          },
          {
            "id": "rec_cii1kajjtoj0t82ae3ag",
            "title": "Semantic or keyword search for finding ChatGPT context. Who searched it better?"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "rec_cie05ljjtojbm41fv2qg",
      "name": "Joan Edwards",
      "postsauthor": {
        "records": [
          {
            "id": "rec_cie060jjtojbm41fv2u0",
            "title": "Introducing the new Xata regions: Sydney & Frankfurt"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "rec_cii1ki3jtoj0t82ae3b0",
      "name": "Alex Francoeur",
      "postsauthor": {
        "records": [
          {
            "id": "rec_cii1kpbjtoj0t82ae3c0",
            "title": "End-to-end preview deployment workflows with Xata and Vercel"
          },
          {
            "id": "rec_cii1kjjjtoj0t82ae3bg",
            "title": "The next era of databases are serverless, adaptive, and collaborative"
          },
          {
            "id": "rec_cii1l1rjtoj0t82ae3cg",
            "title": "Modern database workflows with GitHub, Vercel, Netlify, and Xata"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Using this syntax we are able to avoid the N + 1 problem - getting all the data we want using a single request and, therefore, avoiding any unnecessary roundtrips and repetitive code.

More fields are available to configure the projection further: `as`, `sort`, `limit`, `offset`. The same request can be modified like the following:

<TabbedCode tabs={['TypeScript', 'Python', 'JSON']}>
```ts
const records = await xata.db.users
    .select(["*", {
        "name": "<-posts.author",
        "as": "posts",
        "sort": [
            { "title": "desc" }
        ],
        "columns": ["title"],
        "limit": 1,
        "offset": 1
    }])
    .getAll();
```
```python
records = xata.data().query("posts", {
  "columns": [
    "*",
    {
      "name": "<-posts.author",
      "as": "posts",
      "sort": [
        { "title": "desc" }
      ],
      "columns": ["title"],
      "limit": 1,
      "offset": 1
    }
  ]
})
```
```jsonc
// POST /db/blogs:main/tables/users/query
{
  "columns": [
    "*",
    {
      "name": "<-posts.author",
      "as": "posts", // Field is returned as `posts`
      "columns": ["title"],
      "sort": [      // Return the nested records in this order
          {"title": "desc"}
      ],
      "limit": 1,    // Limit the amount of nested records to 1
      "offset": 1    // Skip first nested record
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabbedCode>

```jsonc
// Response (xata fields have been omitted for clarity)
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "rec_cie05krjtojbm41fv2q0",
      "name": "Tudor Golubenco",
      "posts": {
        "records": [
          {
            "id": "rec_cii1kajjtoj0t82ae3ag",
            "title": "Semantic or keyword search for finding ChatGPT context. Who searched it better?"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "rec_cie05ljjtojbm41fv2qg",
      "name": "Joan Edwards",
      "posts": {
        "records": [
          {
            "id": "rec_cie060jjtojbm41fv2u0",
            "title": "Introducing the new Xata regions: Sydney & Frankfurt"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "rec_cii1ki3jtoj0t82ae3b0",
      "name": "Alex Francoeur",
      "posts": {
        "records": [
          {
            "id": "rec_cii1kjjjtoj0t82ae3bg",
            "title": "The next era of databases are serverless, adaptive, and collaborative"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For the moment, sorting options and classical pagination (limit and offset) are available for the reverse link querying. In the future, we will add support for filtering and cursor pagination. Similarly, we plan to add support for following multiple reverse links transitively. Nevertheless, for now, we know that this functionality addresses most use cases.

## PostgreSQL implementation

We evaluated three different strategies:

- **Subqueries:** This approach is useful for when you need to perform operations that involve multiple tables or when you need to filter data based on the results of another query. The primary advantage is that we wouldn't have to increase the number of queries. Although, this is at the cost of introducing some complexity into the existing query and statement builder code.

- **JOINS:** With this approach, we also maintain the same number of queries, but the code could become significantly more intricate, and we would need to deal with filtering out substantial amounts of duplicated data within each row.

- **N+1 queries:** This approach keeps our SQL straightforward, albeit at the expense of still executing N+1 queries to the database and subsequently joining the responses together. Nonetheless, this represents an improvement because the latency (backend - PostgreSQL) is an order of magnitude lower than the latency (client - backend).

For now, we have opted for the subquery approach due to its simplicity and its adaptability for future changes if the need arises. To further simplify the process, we are leveraging the [json_agg()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html) function to get a JSON document with all the related data ready to be returned in the response.

Using subqueries in PostgreSQL simplifies complex queries, makes code more readable, avoids data duplication, and promotes code reusability. PostgreSQL's query optimizer can improve query performance with subqueries, which also support dynamic filtering, scalability with large datasets, and cross-platform compatibility through adherence to SQL standards.

## Conclusion

The new Xata querying syntax makes it possible to traverse the N:1 relationships backwards and therefore solves the N + 1 problem in a single round-trip.
