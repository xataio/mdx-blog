## Introduction

This is it! Finally! After few months of crafting this new product/example/playground, XataForm made it and is now open-source and ready to be used by you!

Waitâ€¦ What is XataForm? ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m glad you asked!

You probably know the amazing [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/), if you donâ€™t, please have a look, itâ€™s product to create forms. Why do we need them?

- Creating survey to understand your customer
- Organizing your next crÃªpes party
- Ask for feedbacks
- â€¦

And XataForm in this story? XataForm is a light clone of Typeform, build on top of Xata, with our favorite stack: Next.js, trpc, clerk and vercel. We are doing this for multiple reasons. First, we wanted to stress test Xata in a production-ready application, so we can discover all the friction points, see whatâ€™s easy, whatâ€™s not, and learn about our own product! #dogFooding

Second, we are using a lot of forms internally, and we are quite sure that you also do. As far as we know, we didnâ€™t find any open-source solution to handle this need, so you can own your data and customize the product to your specific needs.

Third and last, this is fun! You canâ€™t imagine how many hidden challenges you have building this kind of product! As example, we tried to make everything accessibleâ€¦ and oh boy, this was challenging! I will probably talk more about this in future blog posts!

## Tour of the product

Letâ€™s be honest, if you are familiar with Typeform, you should feel at home. But just in case, letâ€™s have a quick tour together.

### Dashboard

With all the simplicity, everything starts in your dashboard, here you can create a new form and manage existing ones.

Letâ€™s create our first form:

And just like this, we are ready to prepare our next crÃªpes party! (yes, Iâ€™m french and love clichÃ©s ðŸ˜…)

Clicking on the `+` button I can create new questions

  width="1910"
  height="1106"
  alt="Add a question"
  caption="Add a question"
  position="center"
/>

I can edit the order of my questions by drag\&dropping them on the left sidebar

  width="1911"

Now that Iâ€™m happy with the content, I can click on the top right `Preview` button to visualize the form in its published shape.

Everything looks nice (I hope), this is time to publish our first form!!!!

Tadaaaaaaa ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

Now we can click on `Live` to copy the public form URL, and share it to our friends.

_Few moments later_

  alt="Responses to the form"

Oh oh, we do have some responses! ðŸ˜€ Letâ€™s see them in our `Results` tab

Letâ€™s take an instant to point out a little subtility here, on the right side, you can see that we are on `Version 1`.

Indeed, the version will increase every time I push the `Publish` button! Every version has its own Xata table with the proper schema under the hood.

This is to ensure we are never losing any data and everything is in sync. Here is how this looks in Xata UI.

  width="1904"
  height="578"
  alt="Results in Xata"

We are using a separate database called `xataform-answers` with generated table following this pattern: `{formId}-v{version}`

The published form is cached for better performance, and if somebody is submitting an old form, their answer will go to the proper version, as simple as that.

With this in mind, you should try to publish as little as possible, because doing it often will make your life harder to analyze the results. Changing a survey in the middle of its lifetime is a bad practice as this will spoil your results! Not a big deal for our crÃªpes party, but if Iâ€™m asking one more question, the previous version will not have this question!

I guess thatâ€™s it for the tour! No illustration yet, neither logic between questions, but those is coming! I canâ€™t wait to see what you will do with this new tool! Time for you to play!

## How do I play?

You have two options:

- Use the [hosted version](https://xataform.com/), but just so you know, we will have access to all the answers, questions, and so on. This is for demo purposes only.
- Clone and host the tool yourself. It's easy to deploy on Vercel/Netlify + Xata.

All the instructions are inside the Readme of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xataio/xataform). If you encounter any problems, or have any questions or features requests, just open an issue or go to our [discord](https://xata.io/discord)
