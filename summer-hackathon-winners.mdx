To celebrate another [Xata Launch Week](https://xata.io/launch-week-elephant-on-the-move), we kicked off a [Summer Hackathon](https://xata.io/blog/summer-launch-pxci-hackathon) two weeks ago in collaboration with our friends at [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/), where we set a challenge to create an app using the [PXCI stack](https://github.com/inngest/next-pxci-starter).

We have been impressed by the sheer amount of entries and creativity that went into each and every submission, so a huge thank you to everyone that took part. Now it‚Äôs time to reveal the winners üéâ

As a reminder here‚Äôs a snapshot of the judging criteria and potential scores to earn across each area.

# Winners

It was a tough choice but a huge congratulations to our three winners!

## 1st Place: That Rundown

The Rundown is a Chrome extension that sits on top of YouTube in the background enabling you to summarize any video into chapters and save that info for later. A useful use-case for those who consume a lot of video and would like a way to save their summaries for later or for those busy individuals who would like a summary to help them prioritize which videos to watch next! Check out this demo video of how it works.
